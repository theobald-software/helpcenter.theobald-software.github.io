### Access the yunIO Designer

To access the yunIO Designer, enter the designer-URL in a [web browser](../requirements/#supported-web-browsers).\
The URL pattern to access the yunIO Designer is `http(s)://[host or IP address]:[port]`.

- If the yunIO service runs on a local server, replace `[host]` with *localhost*.
- If the yunIO service does not run on the same machine as the browser, replace `[host]` with the name or IP address of the host on which the service runs.
- After the installation the yunIO Designer is accessible under the default port 8077.\
  The port can be configured in the [*Settings*](../../server-settings/) menu of the Designer.

Note

Make sure that the YunIO Service is running on your windows system and that the default port 8077 is not blocked by your firewall.

### Version Number

To check your current version number, navigate to the *About* menu in the yunIO Designer.\
The version number is displayed next to the page title.
