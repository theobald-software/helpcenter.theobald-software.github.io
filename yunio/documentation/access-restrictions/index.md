This section contains information on how to set up access restrictions. YunIO allows you to restrict access to the Server and Designer (global access), as well as for specific services (service access).

### Workflow

1. If no users exist, [create a new user](user-management/).
1. Assign [global access rights](global-access/) to the user in the *Access Control* menu.
1. Optional: To restrict access on the service-level, assign [service access rights](service-access/) in the *Services* menu.

More information on access restriction is provided in the following sections:

- [Restrict Server & Designer Access](global-access/)
- [Restrict Service Access](service-access/)
