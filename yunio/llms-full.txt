Example:

Warning

**RFC_ERROR_SYSTEM_FAILURE - No more storage space available for extending an internal table**\
To avoid a memory overflow on the SAP source system and to avoid huge overheads, choose a package size that suits your memory capacity.

Note

The corresponding SQL command is generated dynamically and executed on the SAP server.


This section contains an alphabetical list of words often used in relation to yunIO.

### `Basic Authentication`

: Basic Authentication is a method for an HTTP user agent (e.g., a web browser) to provide a username and password when making a request. When Basic Authentication is set up for yunIO services, users are required to provide credentials before executing the service.

### `Designer`

: "Designer" refers to the yunIO web UI. For more information, see [Designer](#).

### `Endpoint`

: An endpoint in yunIO is a combination of the yunIO base URL and an HTTP method. For more information, see [Endpoint](#).

### `Integration Type`

: The integration type defines which SAP objects yunIO is to access. yunIO offers the following integration types:

```
- [Function](#)
- [Table](#)
- [Report](#)
- [Transaction](#)
```

### `Service`

: Services are the main entities in yunIO. When called, a yunIO web service queries the data that is defined in the integration type of the service from the assigned SAP source. The queried data is then returned to the caller in the HTTP response of the service.\
A list of all services is displayed in the *Services* menu of the designer, see [Creating a Service](#).

### `Source`

: A source represents a connection to an SAP system. For more information, see [SAP Connection](#).

### `Swagger/OpenAPI`

: OpenAPI is the specification used by yunIO services. The services are implemented in the Swagger 2.0 format. For more information, see [OpenAPI Specification](https://swagger.io/specification/v2/).

### `Transactions`

: Transaction is the name of an integration type supported by yunIO, see [Transactions](#). In this context, transactions refer to SAP transaction codes that can be executed via yunIO.

### `Transport Layer Security (TLS)`

: TLS is a security protocol to ensure a safe data transfer when calling yunIO services via an HTTPS connection. For more information, see [Transport Layer Security](#).

This section contains user documentation for yunIO.

### About yunIO

yunIO is a no-code application for designing, automating, and integrating SAP processes in the cloud. The service offers easy integration of SAP data and business processes in different platforms and applications.

yunIO provides REST-based services to read and write data from and to connected SAP systems. The web services can be easily integrated into your process automation solutions, e.g. Power Automate, Nintex, etc.

### Software Architecture

yunIO comes with an embedded Web UI, the yunIO Designer, that can be accessed through a standard web browser. A Windows service enables connectivity with SAP.

The yunIO service is installed on a local or cloud-hosted Windows server environment. If yunIO is installed on a local server environment, a Gateway instance of your choice (e.g. Microsoft on-premises data gateway) can be used to securely tunnel the connection.

### Integration Types

yunIO offers the following integration types to cover a wide range of integration scenarios.

| Integration Type | Description | | --- | --- | | [*Function module / BAPI*](../function-modules-and-bapis/) | Execute BAPIs and Function Modules. | | [*SAP Table and View*](../tables-and-views/) | Extract data from SAP tables and views. | | [*Transaction*](../transactions/) | Execute SAP transactions without SAP GUI interaction. | | [*Report*](../reports/) | Extract data from SAP ABAP reports. |

This section contains information on the server and transaction logs created by yunIO. The logs are accessible in the *Logs* menu in the Designer.

### Display Logs in Designer

The logs are located in the *Logs* section of the yunIO Designer.\
There are three types of logs:

| Type of log | Description | | --- | --- | | *Service Runs* | Displays a list of the latest service runs, including the status of the service run. | | *Service Workers* | Displays logs of service worker processes. For each TCP connection, a service worker process is started. It receives the HTTP request, executes the service, and sends the response to the caller. | | *Transaction Workers* | Displays logs of [Transaction](../transactions/) services. When running Transactions services, a transaction worker process is started. It executes the service and produces the response, which is then forwarded to the caller by the service worker. |

### Service Runs

The list of service runs consists of the following columns:

- Name of the service
- Date of the log
- Duration of the service run
- State of the service run (*Running*, *FinishedErrors*, *FinishedNoErrors*)

Click a service run to display the corresponding extraction log .

### Service Workers and Transaction Workers

The logs of the service worker and transaction worker consist of two sections:

- Timestamps of the logs
- Content of the logs

Click a timestamp to open the corresponding logs.

#### How to Read Worker Logs

A single log has the following format: `Time | Type | Source | Message`.

Example:

| Time | Type | Source | Message | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | PT00H00M43.777S | D | ExecutionCore: | Extraction finished, firing callback |

#### Time

Each log has a timestamp that uses pacific time (PT) in hours (H), minutes (M) and seconds (S), e.g., `PT00H00M43.777S`.

#### Type

Each log entry is assigned one of the following message types:

| Type of log entry | Description | | --- | --- | | *E - Errors* | Error messages issued during the extraction process. | | *I - Information* | Status messages, about processes that do not lead to an error. | | *W - Warnings* | Information about problems that do not lead to an extraction error, e.g., authentication errors. | | *D - Debug Details* | Detailed information that helps finding error cause. |

### Logs Directory

The following list shows all logs that are created in the `logs` folder of yunIO's installation directory, e.g., in `C:\Program Files\Theobald Software\yunIO\logs`:

| Folder | Subfolder | Description | | --- | --- | --- | | diagnostic_runs | - | Contains debug information about transaction services. This folder is only created when diagnostics mode is enabled in the settings of a transaction service. | | extractions | - | Contains logs (.json and .log files) for every service run. The .json file contains the duration and result status of the run and the .log file contains the details of the run. | | servers | | Contains server logs. The subfolders `azurerelay`, `designer`, `services` and `websockets` each represent a web server used by yunIO. Each server has a listener and a worker. The listener listens on the configured port of the server for connections (listener logs). Each connection starts a worker that processes requests (worker logs). | | | azurerelay | Contains listener logs for Azure Relay connections. This folder is only created when the [server settings](../server-settings/) are set to use an *Azure Hybrid Connection*. | | | designer | Contains listener and transaction logs. The transaction logs are created when recording a transaction in the Designer. | | | services | Contains listener, worker and transaction logs. The transaction logs are created when a transaction service is run. | | | websockets | Contains listener and worker logs of the websocket server that provides the yunIO Designer with data. | | ServiceLog.txt | - | Logs of the yunIO Windows service. |

Tip

To redirect logs to another location, symlink the logs folder of yunIO's installation directory to a custom directory. Example for PowerShell:\
`New-Item -ItemType SymbolicLink -Target "E:\yuniolog" -Path "C:\Program Files\Theobald Software\yunIO\logs"`

yunIO supports dynamization of extractions using input parameters in the following integration types:

- SAP Table and View
- Report
- Transaction

When using [Transaction](../transactions/#parameterize-transactions) and [BAPI](../function-modules-and-bapis/#parameterize-the-service) you can define custom parameters.

Input parameters require users to pass actual values when running a yunIO service. SAP system variables can be also used for parametrization of SAP Table and View integration type using [WHERE Clause](../tables-and-views/where-clause/#sap-system-fields).

### List of Available Parameters

The number of available parameters depends on the integration type.\
Example: *whereClause* is a parameter specific to the integration type *SAP Table and View*.

| Parameter | Description | Integration Type | Example Syntax | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | rows | Sets the maximum number of rows to be extracted | Available for [SAP Table and View](../tables-and-views/settings/#row-limit) | `http://yunio.example:8075/services/KNA1/?rows=10` | | packageSize | Sets the package size | Available for [SAP Table and View](../tables-and-views/settings/#rows-per-package) | `http://yunio.example:8075/services/KNA1/?packageSize=1000` | | whereClause | Sets a WHERE clause | Available for [SAP Table and View](../tables-and-views/where-clause/) | `http://yunio.example:8075/services/KNA1/?whereClause=LAND1 = 'DE'` | | variant | Name of a variant | Available for [Report](../reports/settings/#variant) | `http://yunio.example:8075/services/RLT10010/?variant=VAR01` | | skipPopups | Defines how to handle unexpected popup messages that show up at runtime. | Available for [Transaction](../transactions/#skip-popups) | `http://yunio.example:8075/services/RLT10010/?skipPopups=true` |

Note

When defining a [WHERE clause in an editor](../tables-and-views/where-clause/#parameterize-the-where-clause), make sure to use single quotation marks around values. The browser automatically replaces the spaces and converts the quotation marks.

### Add Parameters in the Service URL

Follow the steps below to add parameters to a service call:

1. Navigate to the *Services* menu at the left side navigation area of the Designer.
1. Click to copy the URL of the service definition to your clipboard.
1. Paste the copied URL into a browser of your choice and add an input parameter using the following syntax:\
   `http://[host]:[port]/service/[service name]/?[param_1]=[value]&[param_2]=[value]`
1. Once the parameter is defined, press **[Enter]**.

This page shows how to test, integrate and pass parameters to services created in yunIO.

### Run Services in yunIO

Follow the steps below to pass parameters and testrun the service directly in yunIO:

1. Navigate to the *Services* menu at the left side navigation area of the Designer.

1. Click to open the *Run Service* menu of a service.

1. If [Access Restrictions](../access-restrictions/) are enabled, enter valid user credentials . If no restrictions apply, the credentials input is grayed out.

1. If the service requires input parameters, enter values for the parameters . Use the **[ + ]** button to display nested items. The depicted example uses an input parameter *NAME*.

   Tip

   Click **[Edit]** to add or delete parameters.

1. Click **[Run]** to execute the service. The response body of the service is displayed under *Output Parameters* .

   Tip

   If the response body returns an error message, click **[Logs]** to open the [logs](../logs/) of the service run.

1. Click **[Close]** to close the *Run Service* menu.

The following control buttons in the *Run Service* menu regulate the display of input and output parameters.

| Button | Description | | --- | --- | | | Collapses all parameter items. | | | Expands all parameter items. | | | Saves all entered parameters in a .json file. The file can be used to reload the parameter values or to share values with other yunIO instances. | | | Uploads parameter values from a local .json file. The json file can be created using . | | | Removes all defined input parameters. This option is only available for input parameters. | | | Displays the parameters in a full screen view. To close the full screen view, click **[ X ]**. |

### Integrate Services with 3rd-Party-Tools

Web services created with yunIO can be integrated into all cloud applications that support REST API/Swagger (OpenAPI), e.g. Power Automate, Nintex, etc.

- Click to copy the URL of the service definition to your clipboard.\
  The service definition URL can be used by third-party-tools to load the meta data of the service.
- Click to download the service definition.\
  The service definition is saved as a JSON file that defines how to run the service. The JSON file can be imported into third-party tools.

The [knowledge base](/yunio/knowledge-base/) contains articles about multiple integration scenarios, including the following:

### Pass Parameters

How parameters are passed to a yunIO service, depends on the http method that is used to call the service. yunIO supports the http methods `POST` and `GET`, see [POST vs GET](#post-vs-get).

Parameters are listed in the request body of a service. Edit the request body to assign values to the parameters. The depicted example uses an input parameter *NAME*:

Parameters are available as query parameters in the service URL. Use query parameters to assign values or add the values directly in the service URL. The depicted example uses an input parameter *NAME*:

Note

If URL parameters contain characters other than `A–Z a–z 0–9 - _ . ! ~ * ' ( )` use an escape sequence for the characters. Some characters can break the URL, e.g., `# % &`.

### POST vs GET

yunIO services support the http methods `POST` and `GET`.

| | POST | GET | | --- | --- | --- | | Data Length | No restrictions. | Maximum URL length is 2048 characters. | | Parameters | Parameters are part of the http request body. | Supports query parameters in the URL. | | Data Safety | Parameters are not stored in the browser history or in web server logs. | Parameters are visible in the service URL. Data is cached. | | Data Types | No restrictions. | Only supports ASCII characters. |

Recommendation

We recommend using the POST method with [Transport Layer Security](../server-settings/) (HTTPS) to ensure data protection. Do not use the GET method to send sensible data, e.g. credentials.

This section contains an overview of the yunIO server settings in the *Settings* menu. Any changes made in this menu only take effect after clicking **[Save]** and restarting the yunIO Windows service.

### Services Endpoint

#### Service URL Kind

The *Service URL Kind* defines the URL that is used to connect to yunIO services.

| *Service URL Kind* | Description | | --- | --- | | *Default* | If TLS is active, the first *Subject Alternative Name* provided by the X.509 certificate is used as the hostname, see [Transport Layer Security](#transport-layer-security). | | *Custom* | Allows you to enter a custom hostname. Enter the hostname in the field **Custom Hostname** and click **[Save]** to update the OpenAPI definitions of all existing services. | | *Azure Relay Hybrid Connection* | When an Azure Relay Hybrid Connection is set up, yunIO services use an Azure Relay address to become accessible to applications running in the Azure cloud. For more information on Azure Relay, see [Establish an Azure Relay Hybrid Connection to yunIO](../../knowledge-base/establish-an-azure-relay-hybrid-connection/). |

Note

Wildcard certificates are supported. Enter the hostname of the certificate as a custom endpoint.

Tip

To set up multiple endpoints, use multiple yunIO servers, one for each endpoint.

#### OpenAPI Target Kind

The *OpenAPI Target Kind* defines properties that can be added to the Swagger/OpenAPI json file of yunIO services.

| *OpenAPI Target Kind* | Description | | --- | --- | | *Default* | If this option is active, the Swagger/OpenAPI json file contains no additional properties. | | *Nintex Gateway* | Select this option when integrating yunIO services with the [Nintex Gateway](https://help.nintex.com/en-US/nwc/Content/Gateway/InstallAndConfigure.htm). Nintex properties are added to into Swagger/OpenAPI json file and there is no need to manually change the swagger definition. For more information, see [Integrate a yunIO Service via Nintex Gateway](../../knowledge-base/integrate-yunio-via-nintex-gateway/). |

### Transport Layer Security

Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol allows the user to communicate with the respective service in a secure way by encrypting the communication with that service (HTTPS). This requires the installation of an X.509 certificate. For more information about the X.509 certificate setup, see [Install an X.509 Certificate](../../knowledge-base/x509-certificate/).

Note

Depending on whether yunIO is hosted on a local server or a cloud environment, the procedure for certificate creation differs. Refer to the documentation available on the internet or contact your network administrators.

For more information on TLS, see [Microsoft: Transport Layer Security Protocol](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthn/transport-layer-security-protocol).

#### TLS enabled

Once a certificate is selected, the option **TLS enabled** is available.\
Enable or disable the usage of transport encryption for the web server.

Note

To access the Designer via TLS, restart the yunIO server and connect to the Designer using the following URL pattern: `https://[host]:[port]`. If you cannot access the designer. because of problems with the TLS certificate, delete the `tls.json` file in the installation directory of yunIO e.g., `C:\Program Files\Theobald Software\yunIO\config\servers\tls.json`. Restart the yunIO server.

### Services, Designer and WebSockets

In the subsections *Services*, *Designer* and *WebSockets* the ports for service consumption, Designer access and WebSocket configurations are defined.

Valid port numbers range from 1-65535. It is not recommended to use ports below 1000, because they are often already taken and using them with different services can lead to service disruptions.

#### Default Ports

| Service Name | HTTP | HTTPS | Description | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | Services | 8075 | 8175 | This port is used by the web server, which handles the requests to invoke a service. | | Designer | 8077 | 8177 | This port is used to open the yunIO Designer on a client machine. | | WebSockets | 8076 | 8176 | This port is used by the yunIO Designer to read and write configurations, services, etc. |

### Usage Data

To improve yunIO and better cater to customer needs, yunIO collects usage data, e.g., the components that are in use, referenced SAP objects, statistics about data extractions, etc. For more information, refer to our [privacy policy](https://theobald-software.com/en/privacy-policy/).

#### Collect Usage Data

When this checkbox is active, usage data is stored in your local installation directory. If this checkbox is deactivated, no usage data is collected.

#### Upload Usage Data

When this checkbox is active, usage data is sent to Theobald Software for analysis. An internet connection is required to use this option.

#### Transfer SAP Object Names

When this checkbox is active, the names of the SAP objects used in extractions are included in the usage data upload.

This section contains information on how to set up access restrictions. YunIO allows you to restrict access to the Server and Designer (global access), as well as for specific services (service access).

### Workflow

1. If no users exist, [create a new user](user-management/).
1. Assign [global access rights](global-access/) to the user in the *Access Control* menu.
1. Optional: To restrict access on the service-level, assign [service access rights](service-access/) in the *Services* menu.

More information on access restriction is provided in the following sections:

- [Restrict Server & Designer Access](global-access/)
- [Restrict Service Access](service-access/)

Global access control allows you to restrict user access to the yunIO server and the yunIO Designer.\
The global access settings are accessible in the *Access Control* menu.

### Restrict Designer and Server Access

Follow the steps below to restrict the access to the Designer and the server. By default, the access restrictions also apply to services. To define custom access restrictions for services, see [Service Access](../service-access/).

1. Navigate to the *Settings* menu.
1. Enable *Transport Layer Security*, see [Server Settings: Transport Layer Security](../../server-settings/#transport-layer-security).
1. Restart the Windows yunIO service and connect to the Designer using an HTTPS connection.
1. Navigate to the *Access Control* menu.
1. Set the *Server Access* to **Authenticated**, see [Server Access](#settings) .
1. Assign a restriction level to existing users, see [Privileges](#privileges) .
1. Click **[Save]**.
1. Restart the Windows yunIO service again.

When connecting to the Designer, you are now prompted to enter user credentials:

Note

If you lock yourself out and cannot login to the Designer, delete the `permission.json` file in the installation directory of yunIO e.g., `C:\Program Files\Theobald Software\yunIO\config\servers\permission.json`. Restart the yunIO server afterwards.

Tip

You can also use SAP credentials for basic authentication, see [SAP Connection](../../sap-connection/). Using SAP credentials and custom user credentials for basic authentication in parallel is not supported.

### Settings

To open the global access settings, navigate to the *Access Control* menu.

#### Server Access

Activate or deactivate access control for the Designer and the server.

| Server Access | Description | | --- | --- | | **Anonymous** | If active, anyone can access the Designer and execute services. **Anonymous** is the default setting. | | **Authenticated** | is active, only defined users with a designated restriction level have access to the Designer and the server. This option is available, if at least one user is defined and [Transport Layer Security](../../server-settings/) is enabled. |

#### Privileges

All users defined in the [*Users* menu](../user-management/) are listed in the subsection *Privileges*.

Select a restriction level from the dropdown list next to the user name to assign a restriction level. The following restriction levels are available:

| Restriction Level | Description | | --- | --- | | *Server Admin* | No restrictions. | | *Create / Modify* | The user can login to the designer, create new connections and services, and modify existing ones. The user cannot make changes to users, access control, or server settings. | | *Read / Execute* | The user can login to the Designer, but cannot make any changes. The user can run services. | | *No access* | The user can not login to the Designer or run any services. This option can be used to temporarily disable users from using yunIO. |

Service access control allows you to restrict user access to specific services, e.g., to temporarily disable users from using a service.\
The service access settings are accessible for every service in the *Services* menu.

### Restrict Access to Services

By default services inherit access restrictions from the server-level, see [Global Access](../global-access/). Follow the steps below to further restrict access on the service-level:

1. Navigate to the *Services* menu.
1. Click next to the service you want to restrict access to. The service access settings of the service open.
1. Set the *Service Access* to **Custom**, see [Service Access](#service-access) .
1. Assign a restriction level to existing users, see [Privileges](#privileges) .
1. Click **[Save]**.

When running the service, you are now prompted to enter user credentials (basic authentication).

Note

When access rights from the server and service levels differ, the more restrictive access right applies, e.g., a user with *Read/Execute* privilege on the server level cannot be upgraded to *Modify* on the service level. The *Administrator* privilege is the only privilege on the server level that cannot be downgraded on the service level.

Tip

Click **[Reset permissions]** to set all user rights to *No Access*.

### Settings

To open the service access settings, click next to the service you want to restrict access to.

#### Service Access

Activate or deactivate further restrictions of existing global access rights for the selected service.

This page shows how to use the *Function module / BAPI* integration type.\
The *Function module / BAPI* integration type can be used to parameterize and execute SAP function modules and BAPIs for automation.

### About Function Modules / BAPIs

Function modules are procedures that encapsulate and reuse global functions in the SAP system. SAP systems contain several predefined functions modules that can be called from any ABAP program. A Business Application Programming Interface (BAPI) is a remote function module that can access business data and processes of an SAP system from different systems.

### Prerequisites

- A connection to an SAP system is available, see [SAP Connection](../sap-connection/).
- The SAP user has sufficient user rights, see [SAP Authority Objects](../setup-in-sap/sap-authority-objects/#bapi).

Warning

**Missing Authorization.**\
To use the *Function module / BAPI* integration type, access to the designated authority objects (RFC) in SAP must be available. Adjust [SAP Authority Objects: BAPI](../setup-in-sap/sap-authority-objects/#bapi) accordingly.

### Look up a Function Module / BAPI

1. [Create a new service](../../getting-started/#create-a-service) of integration type *Function module / BAPI*.
1. In the *Search SAP function modules* menu, enter the name of a Function Module / BAPI or a function groups . Use wildcards (\*) if needed.
1. Click **[Search]** to display the search results.
1. Select a source file from the list of available search results .

The settings of the *Function module / BAPI* integration type open.

### Define the *Function module / BAPI* Service

Set up parameters for the service. The necessary parameters of a *Function module / BAPI* service vary depending on the BAPI.

1. Add input parameters (data you want to send to SAP) to the service, see [Import Parameters](settings/#import-parameters).
1. Add output parameters (data you want to receive from SAP) to the service, see [Export Parameters](settings/#export-parameters).
1. Click **[Run]** to check the results, see [Running Services in yunIO](../run-services/#run-services-in-yunio).

### Parameterize the Service

Import parameters can be parameterized in the request body of the service. The depicted example shows the request body of a service where the Import Parameter *NAME* is set to *Supplied by Caller*.

Note

When parameterzing the import parameters of the service, make sure the input matches the data type of the parameters.

### Custom BAPIs

The use of custom BAPIs (Z function modules) is possible. Issues specific to Z function modules are not included in the scope of support provided by Theobald Software.

This section contains an overview and description of all available *Function module / BAPI* settings.

#### Dynamic column width and offset

When the checkbox "Dynamic column width and offset" is activated, the column width and offset are adjusted dynamically at report runtime. Alternative requirement for reports that have varying column widths depending on the report’s selection criteria.

#### Skip rows from top

Reports can display meta information in the header section of the report, before the actual report body. The setting **Skip rows from top** allows skipping the meta information.\
Enter the number of rows to skip at the beginning of the report.

#### Skip rows from bottom

Similar to **Skip rows from top**, the setting **Skip rows from bottom** allows skipping rows in the footer section of the report.\
Enter the number of rows to skip at the end of the report.

#### Variant

A variant contains a set of [selections parameters](#selection-parameters) that limit the result set of the report to records that match the selection. A selection variant can be created in SAP at the input screen of an ABAP report. The purpose of a variant is to minimize the necessity to enter selections each time you run a report. If available, variants can be selected from the drop-down-list.

Note

Manual selections and variants can be combined. Manual selections overwrite any selections in the variant.

#### Detect Columns

Detecting columns is mandatory for using the service. Click **[Detect columns]** to execute the report based on the selected variant or selections and detect columns automatically.

Note

If a report has variants, the variant must be selected, before using **[Automatically detect columns]**.

The configuration of services, sources, users and the server are stored in the `config` folder of the yunIO installation directory, e.g., `C:\Program Files\Theobald Software\yunIO\config`. Use the `config` folder for setting up a version control system or for creating manual backups.

| Filename | Description | | --- | --- | | `extractions` | Contains the [service definitions](../../../getting-started/#create-a-service). | | `servers` | Contains the [server settings](../../server-settings/). | | `sources` | Contains the [SAP connections](../../sap-connection/). | | `users` | Contains the [user settings](../../access-restrictions/user-management/). |

### Create a Backup

1. Open the yunIO installation directory of the machine that runs yunIO, e.g., `C:\Program Files\Theobald Software\yunIO`.
1. Copy the complete `config` and `private` folders in the yunIO installation directory and save the folder at a secure location.
1. Optional: copy the complete `logs` folder of the yunIO installation directory to create a backup of the log files.
1. To backup your license, create a copy of your `yunIOLicense.json` file.

Warning

**Data security.**\
The `config`, `private` and `logs` directories may contain sensitive information. Unauthorized access may lead to data breaches. Make sure to secure the backup location.

### Restore a Backup

1. Open the yunIO installation directory of the machine that runs yunIO, e.g., `C:\Program Files\Theobald Software\yunIO`.
1. Remove the `config` and `private` folders from the installation directory.
1. Copy the backup of the `config` and `private` folders into the installation directory.
1. To restore the license, replace the `yunIOLicense.json` file in the installation directory with the backup.

Warning

**Data Loss.**\
Restoring the backup of the `config` and `private` folders replaces the existing configuration. Make sure to remove the existing files before restoring the backups.

### Migrate to a Different Machine

Note

When migrating to a new server, a new license file must be issued for that server.\
Contact our sales team at [sales@theobald-software.com](mailto:sales@theobald-software.com) for more information.

For information on [supported SAP systems](../setup/requirements/#supported-sap-systems-and-releases) and other IT topics, see [Setup](../setup/).

### Custom Function Modules

The following integration types require the installation of a custom function module:

| Integration Type | Custom Function Module | Installation | | --- | --- | --- | | *Report* | [Z_XTRACT_IS_REMOTE_REPORT](custom-function-module-for-reports/) | Required | | *SAP Table and View* | [/THEO/READ_TABLE](custom-function-module-for-table-extraction/) | Recommended |

Theobald Software distributes custom function modules as part of yunIO. The custom function modules can be installed in SAP using transport requests. The transport requests are available in the installation directory of yunIO, e.g., `C:\Program Files\Theobald Software\yunIO\ABAP\`.

For information on how to use transport request, see [Import an SAP Transport Request](/yunio/knowledge-base/import-an-sap-transport-request).

Note

All objects that come with any of the transport requests, can be deleted by importing the `Z_THEO_READ_TABLE-deletion_request.zip` transport request.

### Popular Topics

- [SAP User Rights](sap-authority-objects/)
- [Download SAP Roles](sap-authority-objects/#sap-authorization-profiles)
- [Function Module for Table Extractions](custom-function-module-for-table-extraction/)
- [Function Module for Report Extractions](custom-function-module-for-reports/)

The extraction of reports requires the installation of a custom function module in your SAP system.\
If you cannot install the function module, turn to your SAP Basis team for help.

Note

As of version 1.2 of the custom function module `Z_XTRACT_IS_REMOTE_REPORT` access to reports must be explicitly granted, see [Authority Objects for Z_XTRACT_IS_REMOTE_REPORT](#authority-objects-for-z_xtract_is_remote_report).

### Installation of Z_XTRACT_IS_REMOTE_REPORT

Install the function module using the transport request *Z_XTRACT_IS_REMOTE_REPORT-transport.zip*.\
The transport request is located in the following installation directory: `C:\Program Files\Theobald Software\yunIO\ABAP\Report\Z_XTRACT_IS_REMOTE_REPORT-transport.zip`.

The transport request needs to be imported into SAP by your SAP Basis team.

### Authority Objects for Z_XTRACT_IS_REMOTE_REPORT

As of Z_XTRACT_IS_REMOTE_REPORT version 1.2 access to reports must be explicitly granted.\
There are 2 ways to verify that the SAP user is allowed to extract a report:

- Use authentication groups, see [Authorizing Access to Reports via Authorization Groups](../../../knowledge-base/authorize-access-to-specific-reports/).
- Use the custom authorization object Z_TS_PROG.

SAP customization for the *SAP Table and View* integration type is optional. The installation of the custom function module `/THEO/READ_TABLE` is recommended to improve performance and to bypass restrictions of the SAP standard function module RFC_READ_TABLE.

### RFC_READ_TABLE Restrictions

Especially with older SAP releases you may encounter a few restrictions when using the SAP standard function module (RFC_READ_TABLE) for table extraction:

- The overall width of all columns to be extracted must not exceed 512 bytes.
- It is not possible to extract data from tables that contain one or more columns of the data type f (FLTP, floating point), DEC (decimal, e.g. for percentage) or x (RAW, LRAW).
- Poor extraction performance with larger tables. Can cause also duplicates.
- Depending on the SAP version there may be other restrictions.

When facing restrictions, install the Theobald Software custom function module [/THEO/READ_TABLE](./#installation-of-theoread_table) on your SAP system.

Warning

**Converting issues**\
Error while converting value '\*.0' of row 1530, column 3.\
The SAP standard module *RFC_READ_TABLE* for table extraction can only extract the ABAP data type DEC to a limited extent. This leads to the mentioned example error during extraction. Use the function module */THEO/READ_TABLE*.

### Installation of /THEO/READ_TABLE

An SAP transport request for the installation of the function module is provided in the installation directory of yunIO: `C:\Program Files\Theobald Software\yunIO\ABAP\`.\
Transport requests are imported into SAP by your SAP Basis team. For more information, see [Knowledge Base: Import an SAP Transport Request](/yunio/knowledge-base/import-an-sap-transport-request/).

Note

Take a look at the README.pdf in the installation directory (e.g.,`C:\Program Files\Theobald Software\yunIO\ABAP\README.pdf`) before installing any custom function modules.

It is recommended to install the latest custom function module THEO/READ_TABLE:

| Transport Request | Compatible SAP Systems | | --- | --- | | `THEO_READ_TABLE_740SP05.zip` | ABAP version 7.40 SP05 and higher | | `THEO_READ_TABLE_710.zip` | ABAP version 7.10 to 7.40 SP04 | | `THEO_READ_TABLE_640.zip` | ABAP versions from 6.40 until 7.03 | | `THEO_READ_TABLE_46C.zip` | ABAP versions from 4.6C |

When importing the transport requests on older SAP releases a syntax error may occur. Contact [Theobald Support](https://support.theobald-software.com) and send the dedicated error message text.

Warning

**Generating Short Dumps.**\
Testing the function modules on an SAP system is not possible. Function modules /THEO/READ_TABLE and Z_THEO_READ_TABLE can only be called by Theobald Software products due to the callback function of the module. Avoid calling function modules /THEO/READ_TABLE and Z_THEO_READ_TABLE directly from an SAP system.

### Supported Features

| Supported Features by THEO_READ_TABLE | \_740SP05 | \_710 | \_640 | 46C | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | WHERE Clause | | | | | | HAVING Clause | | | | | | INNER JOIN | | | | | | LEFT OUTER JOIN | | | | | | Conversion exits | | | | | | Aggregate functions | | | | | | SQL expressions (subqueries) | | | | | | Background jobs | | | | |

To use yunIO you need an SAP connection user with sufficient authorization in SAP. Authorizations are assigned via authorization objects in SAP. Redirect this page to your SAP Basis administrators to get the relevant authorization objects for your SAP connection user.

The authorizations in the section [General authorization objects](#general-authorization-objects) are required to establish an SAP connection with the SAP application server. The required authorizations for each integration type are listed in their respective section.

### SAP Authorization Profiles

Theobald Software collected and combined the necessary authorizations for all integration types into SAP roles. You can download the SAP profiles and upload them to your SAP system:

| Integration Type | SAP Role File | | --- | --- | | [General Authorization Objects](#general-authorization-objects) | [ZXTGENERAL.SAP](/yunio/assets/files/sap_roles/ZXTGENERAL.SAP) | | [BAPI](#bapi) | [ZXTBAPI.SAP](/yunio/assets/files/sap_roles/ZXTBAPI.SAP) | | [Report](#report) | [ZXREPORT.SAP](/yunio/assets/files/sap_roles/ZXREPORT.SAP) | | [Table](#table) | [ZXTABLE.SAP](/yunio/assets/files/sap_roles/ZXTABLE.SAP) |

Note

If you still get an authorization error, ask SAP Basis to record an ST01-/ or SU53-authorization trace in SAP. This trace shows which authorizations objects are missing.

### Supported SAP Objects

- Transparent tables
- Views
- ABAP CDS Views (without parameters)
- HANA CDS Views
- Pool tables (joining not possible)
- Cluster tables (joining not possible)

### RFC_READ_TABLE Restrictions

Especially with older SAP releases you may encounter a few restrictions when using the SAP standard function module (RFC_READ_TABLE) for table extraction:

- The overall width of all columns to be extracted must not exceed 512 bytes.
- It is not possible to extract data from tables that contain one or more columns of the data type f (FLTP, floating point), DEC (decimal, e.g. for percentage) or x (RAW, LRAW).

When facing restrictions, install the Theobald Software custom function module [/THEO/READ_TABLE](../setup-in-sap/custom-function-module-for-table-extraction/#installation-of-theoread_table) on your SAP system.

Warning

**Converting issues**\
Error while converting value '\*.0' of row 1530, column 3.\
The SAP standard module *RFC_READ_TABLE* for table extraction can only extract the ABAP data type DEC to a limited extent. This leads to the mentioned example error during extraction. Use the function module */THEO/READ_TABLE*.

### Prerequisites

- A connection to an SAP system is available, see [SAP Connection](../sap-connection/).
- The SAP user has sufficient user rights, see [SAP Authority Objects](../setup-in-sap/sap-authority-objects/#table).

Warning

**Missing Authorization.**\
To use the {{ componentName }} integration type, access to the designated authority objects (RFC) in SAP must be available. Adjust [SAP Authority Objects](../setup-in-sap/sap-authority-objects/#table) accordingly.

### Look Up an SAP Table or View

1. [Create a new service](../../getting-started/#create-a-service) of integration type *SAP Table and View*.
1. In the *Search SAP Table or View* menu, enter the name or description of the Table or View to be extracted . Use wildcards ( * ) if needed.
1. Click **[Search]** to display the search results.
1. Select a table / view from the list of available search results .

The settings of the *SAP Table and View* integration type open.

### Define the *SAP Table and View* Service

### Table or View

The **Table or View** section displays the name and description of the selected table or view.

| Icon | Description | | --- | --- | | | Adds a table or view to the service. | | | Removes a table or view from the service. |

### Advanced Settings

#### Function Name

Specifies the name of the function module used for data extraction. This field is filled automatically depending on what function modules are installed on your SAP system. Custom function modules are supported.

The following function modules can be used to extract tables:

- RFC_READ_TABLE (TAB512)
- /BODS/RFC_READ_TABLE (TAB2048)
- /SAPDS/RFC_READ_TABLE (TAB2048)
- /BODS/RFC_READ_TABLE2
- /SAPDS/RFC_READ_TABLE2
- Z_THEO_READ_TABLE
- [/THEO/READ_TABLE](/yunio/documentation/setup-in-sap/custom-function-module-for-table-extraction) (recommended)

Warning

**Duplicates in the target environment.**\
The SAP standard modules for table extraction do not have pointers for table fields. In larger tables this may cause low performance and duplicates in the target environment. Use the function module [THEO/READ_TABLE](../../setup-in-sap/custom-function-module-for-table-extraction/#installation-of-theoread_table) from Theobald Software to ensure smooth extractions.

Note the necessary [SAP Authority Objects](../../setup-in-sap/sap-authority-objects/#table):

```text
S_TABU_NAM ACTVT=03; TABLE=ENLFDIR

```

#### Row Limit

Specifies the maximum number of extracted records. 0 extracts all data. You can use this option to perform tests with a small amount of data by entering a row limit of e.g., 1000.

#### Rows per package

The extracted data is split into packages of the defined size. The default value is 50000 lines.\
A package size between 20000 and 50000 is advisable for large amounts of data. 0 means no packaging. Not using packaging can lead to an RFC timeout for large data extractions.

Warning

**RFC_ERROR_SYSTEM_FAILURE - No more storage space available for extending an internal table**\
To avoid a memory overflow on the SAP source system and to avoid huge overheads, choose a package size that suits your memory capacity.

#### Run in background

If *Background job timeout (seconds)* checkbox is activated, the table extraction is executed as a background job in SAP. This setting is optional and is supported in combination with function module THEO/READ_TABLE or Z_THEO_READ_TABLE version 2.0. Activate the setting *Background job timeout (seconds)* for long-running extractions with a large amounts of data that may run into a timeout error (“Time limit exceeded”), when using the foreground mode.

Tip

The extraction jobs can be found in the SAP JobLog (**SM37**) under the JobName *theo_read_table*.

Warning

**Shared Memory ran out of memory!**\
If this error message pops up when running an extraction in the background, adjust the size of the Shared Memory. SAP recommends a Shared Memory size of 800MB~1.5GB for a production/test system or 2GB~4GB for S/4 systems, see [SAP Support: How to solve SYSTEM_NO_SHM_MEMORY runtime error](https://ga.support.sap.com/dtp/viewer/#/tree/1080/actions/12107).

#### Refresh metadata

A new lookup is performed on the selected table(s). Existing mappings and field selections are kept, which is not the case when the table is added again. Use this function to resolve data inconsistencies that can occur in the following situations:

- the structure of the source table has been changed in SAP
- another SAP source system has been connected
- the SAP source system has been updated

### Output Columns

You can select either all or only individual columns for extraction.\
Per default all columns are selected to be extracted. Deselect the columns you don’t want to extract.

### WHERE Clause

You can use a WHERE clause to filter table records, see [SAP ABAP Documentation: SELECT-WHERE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_750_index_htm/7.50/en-us/abapwhere.htm). Enter WHERE clauses manually in *Text mode* or use the [WHERE Clause Editor](../where-clause/#where-clause-editor) in *Editor Mode*.

### Joins

You can join two or more SAP tables and extract the result of the join, see [SAP Help: Inner Join and Outer Join](https://help.sap.com/doc/saphelp_nwpi71/7.1/en-US/cf/21ec77446011d189700000e8322d00/content.htm?no_cache=true). For information on how to join tables in yunIO, see [Table Joins](../table-join/).

The *Join* functionality allows joining two or more tables and extract the result of the join. To perform the extraction the corresponding SQL command is generated dynamically and the join is executed on the SAP server.

Possible scenarios can be joining tables for header and item data or tables for master data and texts.

### Supported Join Types

The following join types are supported:

- Inner Join
- Left Outer Join, also referred to as *Left Join*.

For more information on join types see [SAP Help: Inner Join and Outer Join](https://help.sap.com/doc/saphelp_nwpi71/7.1/en-US/cf/21ec77446011d189700000e8322d00/content.htm?no_cache=true).

Note

Joining of cluster or pool tables is not supported. Cluster or pool tables need to be extracted individually and joined in the destination.

### Prerequisites

To use table join, the function module [/THEO/READ_TABLE](../../setup-in-sap/custom-function-module-for-table-extraction/#installation-of-theoread_table) needs to be available in SAP.

### Join Tables

The following example shows how to join the tables KNA1 and KNVV.

1. [Create a new service](../../../getting-started/#create-a-service) of type *SAP Table and View* or edit an existing service.

1. [Look up](../#look-up-an-sap-table-or-view) the first table or view, e.g, KNA1.

1. Click to add the additional tables for the join, e.g., KNVV .

1. Define the [output columns](../settings/#output-columns) you want to extract for both tables .

1. Optional: define a [WHERE clause](../where-clause/) for the tables.

   Note

   Specifying a WHERE-clause to the right table of a LEFT OUTER JOIN is only possible as of SAP Release 7.40, SP05. If your SAP system is older than SAP Release 7.40, SP05, the following error occurs: *RFC_ERROR_SYSTEM_FAILURE - Illegal access to the right table of a LEFT OUTER JOIN*.

1. Click **[Add join]** . The *Join Editor* opens.

1. If necessary, change the default values of *Left Table*, *Right Table* and *Join Type*.

1. Click **[Join/Add]** . A new join condition is added to the join.

1. Select a table column in the *Left Table* field and in the *Right Table* field to map the table contents. It is possible to add multiple join conditions.

   Tip

   Different tables can have identical field / column names. Defining a join condition based on the identical field names not always delivers the expected result, e.g., VBAK~VBELN \<> LIPS~VBELN. Make sure the fields you use in a join condition contain the same content/data.

1. Click **[OK]** to save the join.

Recommendation

To avoid poor extraction performance, do not join more than five tables.

A WHERE clause can be used to filter table records, see [SAP ABAP Documentation: SELECT-WHERE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_750_index_htm/7.50/en-us/abapwhere.htm). Enter WHERE clauses manually in *Text mode* or use the [WHERE Clause Editor](#where-clause-editor) in *Editor Mode*.

## WHERE Clause Text Mode

The WHERE clause text mode allows you to directly enter a WHERE clauses. Use the toggle to switch between *Text mode* and *Editor mode*.

### WHERE Clause Syntax

The WHERE Clause syntax generally uses the following structure:

```bash
[Table]~[Column][Space][Operator][Space][Filter-Value]

```

**Example:**

```text
KNA1~LAND1 = 'US'

```

The following rules apply to filter values:

| Rule | Correct | Wrong | | --- | --- | --- | | Enter a space before and after the equal sign | *YEAR = '1999'* | *YEAR= '1999 '*, *YEAR ='1999'* or *YEAR='1999'* | | Set floating point numbers in single quotation mark | *KMENG > '10.3'* | *KMENG > 10.3* | | Values must use the internal SAP representation: Date: YYYYMMDD Year Period: YYYYPPP Numbers with leading zeroes, e.g., customer numbers | 19990101 1999001 0000001000 | 01.01.1999 001.1999 1000 |

The following operations are supported in the WHERE clause:

| Operator | Description | | --- | --- | | =, EQ | True if the content of operand1 is equal to the content of operand2. | | \<>, NE | True if the content of operand1 is not equal to the content of operand2. | | \<, LT | True if the content of operand1 is less than the content of operand2. | | >, GT | True if the content of operand1 is greater than the content of operand2. | | \<=, LE | True if the content of operand1 is less than or equal to the content of operand2. | | >=, GE | True if the content of operand1 is greater than or equal to the content of operand2. | | (NOT) LIKE | True if the value of operand1 matches (does not match) the pattern in operand2. | | (NOT) IN | True if the content of operand1 is (not) part of the content of operand2. Operand2 must be of type LIST or SQL. |

For more details on the OpenSQL syntax, see [SAP Help: Select WHERE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapwhere.htm?file=abapwhere.htm)

Tip

To increase extracting performance, make sure to place the indexed fields as the first selection filter operation in the WHERE clause.

Note

When fields with the same name exist in different tables, the field names must be formatted as [table name]~[field name], e.g., MARC~MATNR. This can be the case when extracting multiple tables.

## WHERE Clause Editor

The WHERE clause editor offers a toolkit for those who are not familiar with the syntax of the WHERE clause. Use the toggle to switch between *Text mode* and *Editor mode*.

There are 2 options for adding criteria to the WHERE clause:

- **[Add Criteria]** adds single criteria.

  - The default structure for a single criteria with static values is `[Table~Column][Operator][Filer-Value]` e.g., *MARC~WERKS = 1000*.

- **[Add Criteria Group]** adds a group of criteria.

  - The default structure for a criteria group is `([Table~Column1][Operator1][Filter-Value1][Boolean][Table~Column2][Operator2][Filter-Value2])` e.g., *(MARC~PSTAT = 'L' OR MARC~PSTAT = 'LB')*.

Tip

Combine multiple criteria and criteria groups to create complex filters e.g., *MARC~WERKS = 1000 AND (MARC~PSTAT = 'L' OR MARC~PSTAT = 'LB')* extracts only data where the column WERKS equals 1000 and the column PSTAT equals either 'L' or 'LB'.

### Components of the WHERE Clause Editor

The following buttons and options are available in the WHERE Clause Editor:

| Icon | Component | Function | | --- | --- | --- | | | Delete row | deletes a criteria. | | | Move row up | changes the sequence of the criteria. The selected criteria moves up. The sequence of criteria can also be changed with Drag and drop. | | | Move row down | changes the sequence of the criteria. The selected criteria moves down. The sequence of criteria can also be changed with Drag and drop. | | | Column | adds a column. Click on the component to select a column from the available tables. | | | SQL | adds an Open SQL statement, see [SAP Help: Open SQL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_750_index_htm/7.50/en-us/abenopensql.htm). | | | Operator | adds an operator e.g., =, \<, >, etc. | | | Value | adds a static value of type *String*, *Number*, *Flag* or *List*. *List* offers a separate editor to create lists of type *String*, *Number* or *Select*. *Select* enables usage of SELECT statements. | | | Criteria | adds a new criteria after the selected criteria. | | | Group | adds a new group of criteria the selected criteria. |

Note

When adding or editing a criteria only the relevant components are displayed e.g., **Add Operator** is only available if there is a column or SQL statement to use an operator on.

#### Edit and Delete Components

- Click on a component to edit it. All areas that are marked green can be edited.
- To delete a component, click the icon that appears when hovering over the component.

### SAP System Fields

You can use [SAP system fields for date and time](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_751_index_htm/7.51/en-US/abentime_system_fields.htm) in a WHERE clause. The usage of SAP system fields requires SAP NW 7.4 SP5 or higher and the custom function module [/THEO/READ_TABLE](../../setup-in-sap/custom-function-module-for-table-extraction/#installation-of-theoread_table).

Example:

1. Navigate to [WHERE Clause Editor](#where-clause-editor) and select a column of the type Date *here: BUDAT* .
1. Delete the criterion "Value" and use the criterion "SQL" .
1. Within the "SQL" criterion, use the supported system fields for date and time with a preceding "@" character, *here: @sy-datum* .
1. Click **[Run]** to check the result.

## Parameterize the WHERE Clause

The WHERE clause can be parameterized directly in the [service URL](../../parameters/#add-parameters-in-the-service-url) or in the request body of the service.

For more information on parameterizing services, see [Passing Parameters](../../run-services/#pass-parameters).

Note

An existing WHERE clause is overridden when a WHERE clause is entered in the designated text field or if a WHERE clause is entered in the body of the service definition when running a service.

This page shows how to use the *Transaction* integration type.\
The *Transaction* integration type can be used to access, configure and parameterize SAP transactions for automation.

### About Transaction Codes

Transaction codes represent functions in the SAP system. They can be used in the SAP command field to quickly go to an SAP task and start a function. A transaction code consists of letters and/or numbers, e.g., *VA01* to create sales orders, *ME21N* to create purchase orders, etc. For information on how to use and find transaction codes, see [SAP Help: Using Transaction Codes](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_NETWEAVER_740/b1c834a22d05483b8a75710743b5ff26/f735dd776e724195b5562592a5e88b45.html)

### Prerequisites

- A connection to an SAP system is available, see [SAP Connection](../sap-connection/).
- The SAP connection assigned to a transaction service must use an SAP dialog user.
- *Transaction* communicates with SAP via port 32XX, where XX is the [SAP instance number (Property SystemNumber)](../sap-connection/settings/#system). Make sure that the port is not blocked.

Tip

The transaction feature offers the same functionality as the SAP GUI. Therefore knowing how to navigate the SAP GUI makes it easier to use the transaction feature.

### Record Transactions

1. [Create a new service](../../getting-started/#create-a-service) of integration type *Transaction*.
1. Enter a transaction code .
1. Click **[Start]** to run the transaction. Content from the SAP GUI is displayed.
1. Fill out the input fields as you would in the SAP GUI. Input fields can be parameterized once the transaction is recorded, see [Parameterize Transactions](#parameterize-transactions).
1. Click **[Submit]** to enter your input . All executed actions are logged in the section *GUI Steps* .
1. Click **[Save]** once you finished recording.\
   Alternatively, click **[Stop]** to start parameterizing, see [Parameterize Transactions](#parameterize-transactions).

### Parameterize Transactions

Note

All fields that need to be parameterized must be available in the transaction service as *GUI Steps*. To parameterize a field in a specific tap or menu, the tab or menu must be accessed when recording the transaction.

Follow the steps below to assign input and output parameters to a transaction service.

1. Open the transaction service.
1. In the *GUI Steps* section click the action you want to parameterize. The corresponding input screen opens.
1. Click on the fields you want to parameterize. The window "Parameterize Element" opens. All fields that can be parameterized are highlighted in green when hovering over them.
1. Select **Input** to override the value when running the service. Fields that are set to **Input** become available as input parameters in the request body of the service.
1. Select **Output** to return the value of this field when running the service. Fields that are set to **Output** become available in the response body of the service.
1. Optional: Under **Parameter name** you can edit the name of the parameter.
1. Click **[OK]** to confirm your input.
1. Click **[Save]** to save your changes.

Input parameters are now accessible in the request body of the service .\
Ouput parameters are now accessible in the response body of the service .

### Skip Popups

When recording a transaction workflow, SAP can display dynamic popup screens. The popup screens can vary depending on input values.\
The input parameter `skipPopups` in the request body of the service defines how to handle unexpected popup messages that show up at runtime.

When `skipPopups` is set to *true*, the following actions apply:

| Popup during recording | Popup during a service run | Action | | --- | --- | --- | | x | x | The popup is handled like a regular screen. | | x | | The service ignores the recorded screen and continues to the next screen. | | | x | The popup is confirmed (Return/Enter key). |

### Samples

The knowledge base contains articles on how to create services for the following SAP transactions:

This section contains an overview and description of all available *Transaction* settings.

The *Transaction* settings consist of the following subsections:

- [Control Buttons](#control-buttons) to close, save or delete the service .
- [GUI Steps](#gui-steps) displays the recorded actions .
- [Transaction](#transaction) displays input screens that represent the SAP GUI .

### Control Buttons

**[Delete]**\
Deletes the service.

**[Cancel]**\
Closes the service and dismisses any changes.

**[Run]**\
Opens the *Run Menu* to testrun the service directly in yunIO.

**[Save]**\
Saves changes in the service.

### GUI Steps

When recording a transaction workflow, all actions are logged under *GUI Steps*.

Once the recording is finished, clicking actions opens the corresponding screen. This functionality is used to parameterize the values from in the initial recording, see [Parameterize Transactions](../).

### Transaction

When starting a transaction recording, the subsection *Transaction* displays the content of the SAP GUI.

**[Start]**\
Starts the recording of a transaction code.

**[Stop]**\
Stops the recording of the transaction code.

**[Submit]**\
Equivalent to pressing enter in the SAP GUI.

**Enable Diagnostics Mode**\
When this option is active, debug information about the transaction service are recorded and written to the folder `C:\Program Files\Theobald Software\yunIO\logs\diagnostic_runs\`. Activate the diagnostics mode when necessary, e.g., upon request of the support team.

The following article shows how to set up access control for reports.

To grant access to a report, an authorization group must be assigned to the report.\
Access to the report can then be granted through the S_PROGRAM authorization object, see [SAP Note 338177](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/338177).

### Authorizing Access to Specific Reports

1. Log into SAP and use transaction code SE38 to open the ABAP Editor.
1. Enter the name of the report you want to access and select **Attributes** as the *Subobjects*.
1. Click **[Change]**. A window that contains the program attributes opens.
1. Assign an authorization group.
1. Edit or create a user role you want to grant access to (transaction code PFCG).
1. Manually assign the authorization object S_PROGRAM to the user role.
1. Select the action **SUBMIT** in the S_PROGRAM object field *P_ACTION*.
1. Assign the same authorization group that is assigned to the report to the S_PROGRAM object field *P_GROUP*.
1. Save and generate the authorization.
1. Assign the user role to users.

The following article shows how to manually and automatically renew a X.509 certificate used for TLS in yunIO.

Warning

**Expired Certificate.**\
The Cryptographic key pair associated with the certificate is no longer valid and this may cause security risks. Always use a valid certificate. To access the Designer after a certificate has expired, delete the `tls.json` file in the yunIO installation directory (`C:\Program Files\Theobald Software\yunIO\config\servers\`) and restart the yunIO service. This resets all TLS settings in yunIO, including the certificate selection.

### Renew a Certificate Manually

1. Before the old certificate expires, install a new certificate on the server machine.

1. Open the yunIO Designer and reference the new certificate, see [Server Settings - Transport Layer Security](../../documentation/server-settings/#transport-layer-security).

1. Delete the old certificate from the Microsoft Certificate Store.

1. Block external access to yunIO using the firewall.

1. Open the yunIO Designer and enable anonymous access, see [Access Restrictions - Anonymous Access](../../documentation/access-restrictions/global-access/#settings).

1. Disable TLS in the Designer, see [Server Settings - Transport Layer Security](../../documentation/server-settings/#transport-layer-security).

1. Renew the certificate with the same key using Windows AD Certificate Services.

1. Enable TLS in the Designer with the new certificate.

1. Disable anonymous access in the Designer.

1. Allow external access to yunIO using the firewall.

### Renew a Certificate Automatically

If you're using [win-acme](https://www.win-acme.com/reference/plugins/installation/script) for the renewal of Letsencrypt certificates, run the following PowerShell script with the same client that runs win-acme.

[Download PowerShell Script for Letsencrypt Certificate Renewal](../../assets/files/yunio/yunio-le.ps1)

#### About win-acme

win-acme creates a scheduled task for the renewal process. When this process is triggered, it issues a new certificate and stores it in the Windows Certificate Store. The old certificate is deleted.

#### About the PowerShell Script

The `yunio-le.ps1` script replaces the old certificate in the yunIO settings with the new certificate. No manual changes in yunIO are required.

The `yunio-le.ps1` script requires 2 input parameters:

- the thumbprint of the old certificate
- the thumbprint of the new certificate

The following article shows how to check the accessibility of an SAP system using the [paping.exe](https://code.google.com/archive/p/paping) tool. Alternatively, you can also use the Microsoft [telnet](https://learn.microsoft.com/de-de/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/telnet) tool.

Sometimes the firewall is blocking the traffic to the SAP System. This could be a local firewall, but also a firewall in the destination network. You can use the paping.exetool to ping the port and to check if the firewall is open.

### Ping the SAP System

Use the following syntax with paping.exe:

```console
paping.exe SAPServer -p port -c 3*

```

```console
paping.exe 192.168.0.9 -p 3305 -c 3

```

### Port Numbers

If an SAP-Router is used, the ports are 3299 and 3399.\
If not, the ports are 32XX and 33XX. XX is usually the system number, e.g., 00, or 05.

Some important port numbers:

```console
sapdp00 3200/tcp # SAP Dispatcher. 3200 + Instance-Number
sapgw00 3300/tcp # SAP Gateway. 3300 + Instance-Number
sapsp00 3400/tcp # 3400 + Instance-Number
sapms00 3500/tcp # 3500 + Instance-Number
sapmsSID 3600/tcp # SAP Message Server. 3600 + Instance-Number
sapgw00s 4800/tcp # SAP Secure Gateway 4800 + Instance-Number

```

This article offers conversion tips and code templates for working with yunIO in Power Automate.

### Leading Zeros

Data in SAP often uses leading zeros to maintain a 10 character convention, e.g., KUNNR, MATNR, COST_CTR, etc. yunIO also requires leading zeros for these parameters.

The following code adds leading zeros to a variable *strValue*:\
`concat(substring('0000000000', 0, sub(10,length(variables('strValue')))), variables('strValue'))`

### Date Conversion

When working with yunIO dates use the SAP format "yyyyMMdd".\
The following code converts German ("dd.MM.yyyy") and US ("MM/dd/yyyy") dates to the SAP date format ("yyyyMMdd") for variable *strDate*:

```text
concat(
    substring(variables('strDate'), 6, 4),

    if(contains(variables('strDate'), '/'),
        concat(
            substring(variables('strDate'), 0, 2),
            substring(variables('strDate'), 3, 2)
            ),
        concat(
            substring(variables('strDate'), 3, 2),
            substring(variables('strDate'), 0, 2)
            )
        )
)

```

### Syntax in Different Language Settings

The Power Apps coding syntax is dependent on the configured language settings. This impacts:

- Arguments in function calls
- Fields in a record
- Records in a table

For more information, see [Microsoft: Formula separators and chaining operator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/power-fx/global#formula-separators-and-chaining-operator).

| Author's language decimal separator | Power Apps decimal separator | Power Apps list separator | Power Apps chaining operator | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | . (dot or period) | . (dot or period) | , (comma) | ; (semi-colon) | | , (comma) | , (comma) | ; (semi-colon) | ;; (double semi-colon) |

Example: the English `ClearCollect(SAPData,yunIO_1.ReadCSKT());` becomes `ClearCollect(SAPData;yunIO_1.ReadCSKT())` for German language users.

This article shows how to synchronize Microsoft Copilot with SAP.\
In the following scenario, the capabilities of a copilot chatbot is extended to query data from SAP. A Power Automate workflow provides the functionality to query the data. It calls a yunIO service whenever users request the data via the chatbot.

### Prerequisites

- [Create a new service](../../getting-started/#create-a-service) in yunIO. The depicted sample uses a service that reads material data from the SAP table MAKT.
- Create a Custom Connector for the service in Power Automate, see [Integrate a yunIO Service with Power Automate](../integrate-a-yunio-service-with-power-automate/).

### Setup in Copilot Studio

1. Log into [Microsoft Copilot Studio](https://copilotstudio.microsoft.com/) and create a new copilot, see [Microsoft Documentation: Create a copilot](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot-studio/fundamentals-get-started?tabs=web#create-a-copilot).

1. Open the *Actions* tab and click **[+ Add an action]** . The menu "Step 1 of 3: Choose an action" opens.

1. Click **[Create a new flow]** . A new browser tab with a Power Automate workflow opens.

1. If your yunIO service requires input parameters, create the parameters in the **Run a flow from copilot** trigger action.

   Note

   Input parameters are required when using a yunIO service to write data to SAP. In this case, make sure to assign the input parameters correctly in the Power Automate woekflow.

1. Add a yunIO Custom Connector to the workflow , see [Integrate a yunIO Service with Power Automate](../integrate-a-yunio-service-with-power-automate/).\
   Alternatively, add an **HTTP** action that triggers your yunIO service.

1. If the yunIO service returns a string, skip this step.\
   If the yunIO service returns data that is not a string, add an **Initialize variable** action to assign the correct data type . The depicted example returns multiple items in an array.

1. Add the SAP data as an output parameter to the **Respond to Copilot** action .

1. Save the workflow.

1. Go back to Copilot Studio and click **[Refresh]**. The workflow is now available in the list of actions.

1. Select the workflow. The menu "Step 1 of 3: Choose an action" opens.

1. Click **[Next]**. The menu "Step 2 of 3: Review inputs and outputs" opens.

1. Click **[Next]**. The menu "Step 3 of 3: Review and finish" opens.

1. In the section *Configure*, click **[Edit]** to change the name and description of the action. Copilot selects and runs the action based on the name and description.

1. Click **[Finish]**.

1. Navigate to **[Settings] > Generative AI** and select **Generative (preview)**.

1. Click **[Save]**.

1. Test the copilot chatbot in Copilot Studio.

Use copilot topics to add trigger phrases and more context to the copilot action. For more information, see [Microsoft Documentation: Call a flow from a topic](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot-studio/advanced-use-flow#call-a-flow-from-a-topic).

Note

The number of characters returned by the Power Automate workflow may be limited. This will be improved upon in the future.

This article shows how to synchronize Dynamics 365 Business Central with SAP.\
In the following scenario, data from Dynamics 365 Business Central is used to automatically create customer master data in SAP. The newly created SAP customer number is then written back to Dynamics 365 Business Central.

### About

This article leads you through all necessary steps to set up the following process:

- When a customer account in Dynamics 365 Business Central is modified, a Power Automate workflow is triggered.
- The workflow checks if the customer exists in SAP.
- If the customer does not exist, a yunIO service writes the customer data from Dynamics 365 Business Central to SAP.
- If the customer is successfully created in SAP, the new SAP customer number is written back to Dynamics 365 Business Central.

### Setup in yunIO

yunIO is the connector that reads and writes data from and to SAP. For more information on yunIO, see [Theobald Software: yunIO](https://theobald-software.com/en/yunio/).\
Follow the steps below to set up a yunIO service that adds customers to the customer master data in SAP:

1. [Create a new SAP Connection](../../getting-started/#connect-to-sap) in yunIO.
1. [Create a new service](../../getting-started/#create-a-service) in yunIO. This example uses the integration type *Function Module* for the service.
1. [Look up](../../documentation/function-modules-and-bapis/#look-up-a-function-module-bapi) the standard BAPI BAPI_CUSTOMER_CREATEFROMDATA1 that creates customers in SAP.
1. Set all import parameters you want to transfer from Dynamics 365 Business Central to SAP to *Supplied by Caller* e.g., NAME, CITY, POSTL_COD1, STREET, etc.
1. Select CUSTOMERNO for export. This Export parameter contains the newly created SAP customer number that is written back to Dynamics 365 Business Central.
1. Click to testrun the service in yunIO . For more information, see [Documentation: Run Services in yunIO](../../documentation/run-services/#run-services-in-yunio).
1. Click to download the service definition .

### Setup in Dynamics 365

Customize your Business Central account to provide SAP-related fields, e.g., SAP customer number.\
Business Central’s personalization options do not include the creation of custom fields. Use [custom development](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-reference-overview) or one of multiple available [add-ons](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps) for Dynamics 365 Business Central to create custom fields.

For more information on how to customize table fields via custom development, see [Microsoft Documentation: Development - Table Object](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-table-object).

Note

Creating *Sales Org*, *Distribution Channel* and *Division* in Dynamics 365 Business Central is optional as they can also be set as static values in Power Automate.

### Setup in Power Automate

Follow the steps below to synchronize customer data in Dynamics 356 Business Central with customer data in SAP:

1. Integrate the yunIO service created in [Setup in yunIO](#setup-in-yunio) as a custom connector in Power Automate, see [Integrate a yunIO Service with Power Automate](../integrate-a-yunio-service-with-power-automate/#configure-a-yunio-custom-connector-in-power-automate).
1. Create a new workflow that is triggered when a customer data is modified in the Dynamics 365 Business Central table *customers*.
1. Use a *RowID* to keep track of the modified record.
1. Check if the custom field "SAP Customer Number" created in [Setup in Dynamics 365](#setup-in-dynamics-365) is empty.\
   If the customer does not have an SAP customer number, the customer is created in SAP.
1. Add the yunIO connector created in step 1 to the workflow and map the customer data from Dynamics 365 Business Central to the input parameters of the yunIO custom connector.
1. Check if the SAP customer was created using the yunIO return field TYPE .\
   If TYPE does not equal ‘E’ (error), the SAP customer number is written back to Dynamics 365 Business Central.
1. Add a Business Central **Update Record** tool to write the SAP customer number returned by the yunIO custom connector back to Business Central.
1. Use the *RowID* of the workflow trigger to pass the SAP customer number to the modified record in Dynamics 365 Business Central.
1. Optional: if the customer already has an SAP customer number, use the SAP customer number to call a yunIO service that changes SAP customer data to synchronize the modified data.
1. Turn on the workflow.

Note

As of Business Central 2022 wave 2 (BC21) any changes in Dynamics 365 Business Central are saved automatically. To avoid triggering the Power Automate workflow multiple times due to auto-save actions, add a **Delay** tool after the workflow trigger or schedule the SAP synchronization, e.g., once a day.

### Trigger the Process

1. Open Dynamics 365 Business Central and add a new customer.
1. The Power Automate workflow runs and creates the customer in SAP.
1. Check if the SAP customer number is written back to Dynamics 365 Business Central.

The following article describes how to establish an SNC connection to an SAP source system.

The depicted approach uses an X.509 certificate that provides the logon data of the Windows AD user. The correctness of this X.509 certificate is ensured via the company's internal certification authority (ca).

### Workflow

1. Upon connection start, the Secure Login Client retrieves the SNC name from the SAP NetWeaver AS ABAP.
1. The Secure Login Client uses the authentication profile for this SNC name.
1. The user unlocks the security token, for example, by entering the PIN or password.
1. The Secure Login Client receives the X.509 certificate from the user security token.
1. The Secure Login Client provides the X.509 certificate for single sign-on and secure communication between SAP GUI or Web GUI and the AS ABAP.
1. The user is authenticated and the communication is secured.

Tip

The configuration of the X.509 certificate should be implemented by the network & SAP Basis team and requires basic knowledge in this area.

### Requirements

The following system settings are a prerequisite for using this SNC solution:

- Install the [Secure Login Client](https://help.sap.com/viewer/df185fd53bb645b1bd99284ee4e4a750/3.0/en-US/da610fd072e4409baa8b6a96973b5c67.html).
- The SAP application server is configured and activated for Secure Network Communication (SNC).
- The SNC standard library *sapcryptolib* is used as the SNC solution.
- The following SNC parameters are configured:

| SNC parameter | Value | Example | | --- | --- | --- | | snc/gssapi_lib | Path and file name where the SAP Cryptographic Library is located. | *$(DIR_EXECUTABLE)\\sapcrypto.dll* | | snc/identity/as | Application server's SNC name Syntax: p:\<Distinguished_Name> The Distinguished Name part must match the Distinguished Name that you specify when creating the SNC PSE. | *p:CN=saperp.theobald.local* |

### Step-by-Step Guide

Follow the steps below to set up the SNC connectivity ins SAP:

1. Generate the certificate for the application server and AD-user context from common Certificate Authority (ca).

   Note

   The X.509 certificate is available when placed in folder **Certmgr > Personal > Certificates** within Windows certificate store (user).

1. Convert the .pfx file to SAP PSE format e.g., `sapgenpse.exe import_p12 -p cert.pse cert.pfx`.

1. Import the created PSE file via **TA STRUST > Edit mode > PSE Import > PSE Save as SNC Libcrypto**.

1. Edit the SNC configuration of the corresponding SAP user via transaction SU01 > **SNC** > **SNC Name** = p:\<Full Distinguished_Name>, e.g., `p:EMAIL="RandomUser@domain",CN="Random User",OU="Users",OU="TheobaldSoftware",DC="theobald",DC="local"`.

1. Set up SNC authentication in the yunIO SAP connection settings.

The following article shows how to set up the Azure Relay Hybrid Connection in yunIO.\
An Azure Relay Hybrid Connection can be used to make yunIO services accessible to applications running in the Azure cloud. For more information on Azure Relay, see [Microsoft Documentation: What is Azure Relay?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-relay/relay-what-is-it).

### Setup in Azure

Create an Azure Relay namespace and an Azure Relay Hybrid Connection, see [Microsoft Documentation: Get started with Relay Hybrid Connections HTTP requests in .NET](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-relay/relay-hybrid-connections-http-requests-dotnet-get-started).\
The following settings are required when creating the Azure Relay Hybrid Connection:

1. Deactivate the option **Requires Client Authorization** to send requests to the hybrid connection URL from every browser.
1. Create a *Shared Access Policy* where the options **Send** and **Listen** are enabled.
1. Copy the primary connection string from the *Shared Access Policy* to your clipboard.

The Azure Relay Hybrid Connection is now ready to use.

### Setup in yunIO

The following settings are required in yunIO:

1. Open the *Settings* menu in yunIO.
1. Set **Service URL Kind** to *Azure Relay Hybrid Connection* .
1. Paste the primary connection string from the *Shared Access Policy* of the Azure Hybrid Connection in the field **Azure Relay Connection String** .
1. Click **[Save]** and restart the YunIO service to complete the registration.

The Azure Relay Hybrid Connection in yunIO is now ready to use.

### How to check the Connection

There are multiple ways to check the connection between Azure and yunIO:

- Check the Hybrid Connection in Azure:\
  The number of Listeners that are connected to a Hybrid Connection is displayed in the *Overview* screen of Azure Relay. If the connection to yunIO is established succesfully, the number of Listeners equals 1.

- Check the yunIO logs:\
  Open the *Logs* menu in yunIO and display the latest logs, see [Documentation: Logs](../../documentation/logs/). If the connection to Azure Relay is established successfully, the following log entries are displayed:

  ```text
  PT00H00M26.576S I AzureRelayListener: Found a connection string setting.
  PT00H00M26.578S I AzureRelayListener: Online. Listening...
  PT00H00M26.578S I AzureRelayListener: Server listening...

  ```

The following article shows how to import transport requests for custom functions modules that are included in the installation directory of your product, e.g., `C:\Program Files\Theobald Software\yunIO\ABAP`.

### Upload SAP Transport Requests to SAP

If you have access to the file system of SAP, you can copy and paste the files of your transport request directly into the `data` and `cofiles` folders of your SAP system. If you don't have access to the file system, follow the steps below to upload the files of your transport request using the SAP function module ARCHIVFILE_CLIENT_TO_SERVER:

1. Unzip the transport request provided in the installation directory of your product, e.g., `C:\Program Files\Theobald Software\yunIO\ABAP`.
1. Open SAP and go to transaction AL11.
1. Find the entry DIR_TRANS in the column *Name of Directory Parameter*. Note or copy the path shown in the column *Directory*.
1. Go to SAP transaction SE37.
1. Enter name of function module ARCHIVFILE_CLIENT_TO_SERVER and click **[Test/Execute]**.
1. In the field **PATH** you select your request file from from step 1. The name of the file starts with an "R", e.g., R900472.
1. In the field **TARGET PATH** you construct your target path using the following pattern:\
   `{copied path from step 2}\data\{request file name}`.
1. Enable case-sensitivity and click **[Execute]**. When prompted, confirm the upload.
1. In the field **PATH** you select your cofile from from step 1. The name of the file starts with a "K", e.g., K900472.
1. In the field **TARGET PATH** you construct your target path using the following pattern:\
   `{copied path from step 2}\cofiles\{cofile name}`.
1. Enable case-sensitivity and click **[Execute]**. When prompted, confirm the upload.

The files are now available in SAP.

Note

Another method for uploading files to SAP is the SAP transaction CG3Z. This transaction is only available on ERP systems.

### Import SAP Transport Requests

Follow the steps below to add the transport requests to the import queue and import them:

1. Go to SAP transaction STMS to open the transport management system.
1. Click **[Import Overview]** ( icon).
1. Double click on the import queue in which you want to load the transport request into.
1. Open the transport request selection dialog via **More > Extras > Other Requests > Add**.
1. Select the transport request and confirm. If prompted, confirm the import.
1. Select your transport request from the list and click **[Import Request]** ( icon). The window "Import Transport Request" opens.
1. Enter the target client. If the version of the SAP system where the transport request was created differs from your SAP system version, select the option **Ignore Invalid Component Version**.

### Configure a yunIO Custom Connector in Power Automate

Note

When integrating services from a local yunIO installation with a cloud hosted platform like Power Automate, a gateway to tunnel the connection is recommended, e.g., the [**Microsoft On-premises data gateway**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/data-integration/gateway/). For more information about yunIO networking settings, see [yunIO Networking Scenarios](../networking/).

1. Open the section **Data > Custom Connectors** in Power Automate and click on **+ New custom connector**.
1. Click **Import an OpenAPI file** and give the connector a name of your choice. Select the service definition from [Setup in yunIO](#setup-in-yunio) from your hard drive and click **Continue**.
1. In the **General** tab you can define general information for the custom connector.
1. With **Upload** you can upload a connector icon of your choice. Defining an alternative icon background color or a service description is optional.
1. If you use an on-premises data gateway, activate the checkbox **Connect via on-premises gateway**.
1. **Scheme**: With [TLS enabled](../../documentation/server-settings/#transport-layer-security) in the yunIO server settings, the HTTPS scheme is pre-selected. In this example TLS is disabled, so the HTTP scheme is set.
1. Under **Host** the host address for the yunIO service consumption with its respective port is preset. For local installations the host address is `localhost:[port]`.
1. The **Base URL** represents extensions of the REST service URL that is triggered by the custom connector.
1. In the **Security** tab you can select the authentication type for service consumption.
1. *No authentication* is pre-set. This means that there is no authentication required by users calling the connector.
1. If [*Request credentials from callers when running services*](../../documentation/sap-connection/settings/#authentication) is enabled in the yunIO connection settings, you can also select *Basic authentication*. This means that the SAP user name and password used for the SAP connection, must be stored in the Connection Settings defined in the [**Test** tab](#test-the-service).
1. The depicted example uses *Basic authentication* and labels the parameters *SAP User* and *Password*.
1. The **Definition** tab gives an overview about the yunIO service definition. No changes necessary. This also applies to the **Code (Preview)** tab.

Note

Before the service can be tested in the **Test** tab, the custom connector must be published with **Create connector**.

### Test the Service

1. Navigate to the **Test** tab of the custom connector.
1. Create a connection with **+ New connection**.
1. Enter the credentials of the SAP user you have defined in the yunIO connection settings. If you select to connect via an on-premises gateway in the *General* tab, select your gateway instance.
1. Confirm the settings with **Create connection**.
1. Enter valid import values for the parameters you defined as *Supplied by caller* in the yunIO service settings .
1. Click **Test operation** .
1. Check the SAP response displayed in the request body of the custom connector .

Tip

For services calling Function Modules or BAPIs that use tables or structured input information, switch **Raw Body** off to get a better structured input screen.

### Use the Service in a Power Automate Flow

After a connector is successfully tested, it can be used in a Flow.

1. Add a new action to the Flow and search for the name of the custom connector.
1. Enter values in the input fields of the custom connector.

- [Nintex Gateway](https://help.nintex.com/en-us/nwc/Content/Gateway/InstallAndConfigure.htm)

The following article shows how to integrate yunIO with Microsoft Power Automate and the [Microsoft AI Builder](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/ai-builder/overview).\
AI Builder enables the usage of artificial intelligence to automate processes in Power Apps and Power Automate. Microsoft offers pre-built AI models to start using the tool without training the AI model first.

The depicted example scenario uses an AI Builder template in Power Automate to automatically extract and post invoice information to the backend SAP ERP system. In the SAP system an incoming invoice for a previously created purchase order is booked.

### Prerequisites

- The process for incoming invoice creation must be customized and ready to use in SAP.
- Test the BAPI/function call in SAP with transaction SE37 before building the web service. Note which parameters are needed for the call.

### Setup in yunIO

Create a yunIO service for incoming invoices.

Note

The parameters that are needed to create an incoming invoice are dependent on your customized SAP settings for the invoicing process.

1. [Create a service](../../getting-started/#create-a-service) in yunIO. Select *Function module / BAPI* as the integration type for the service.\
   The depicted example uses the BAPI_INCOMINGINVOICE_CREATE1 to create an incoming invoice in SAP.
1. Set the following import parameters to *Supplied by Caller* (Structure *HEADERDATA*):
   - INVOICE_IND (Indicator: post invoice)
   - DOC_TYPE (Document Type)
   - DOC_DATE (Document Date in Document)
   - PSTNG_DATE (Posting Date in the Document)
   - COMP_CODE (Company Code)
   - DIFF_INV (Different Invoicing Party)
   - CURRENCY (Currency Key)
   - CURRENCY_ISO (ISO currency code)
   - GROSS_AMOUNT (Gross Invoice Amount in Document Currency)
   - PMNTTRMS (Terms of Payment Key)
   - BLINE_DATE (Baseline Date for Due Date Calculation)
   - PMNT_BLOCK (Payment Block Key)
   - PYMT_METH (Payment Method)
   - PMTMTHSUPL (Payment Method Supplement)
   - INVOICESTATUS (Invoice Document Status)
1. Select export parameters FISCALYEAR (Fiscal Year) and INVOICEDOCUMENTNUMBER (Document Number of an Invoice Document) for the output.
1. Select the Table *RETURN* for the output.
1. Set the following fields of table ITEMDATA to *Supplied by Caller*:
   - INVOICE_DOC_ITEM (Document Item in Invoice Document)
   - PO_NUMBER (Purchase Order Number)
   - PO_ITEM (Item Number of Purchasing Document)
   - ITEM_AMOUNT (Amount in document currency)
   - QUANTITY (Quantity)
   - PO_UNIT (Purchase Order Unit of Measure)
1. Click to testrun the service in yunIO . For more information, see [Documentation: Run Services in yunIO](../../documentation/run-services/#run-services-in-yunio).
1. Click to download the service definition .

### Configure a yunIO Custom Connector in Power Automate

To use the service created in [Setup in yunIO](#setup-in-yunio) with Power Automate, it must be available as a custom connector in Power Automate. For information on how to integrate a yunIO service with Power Automate, see [Integrate a yunIO Service with Power Automate](../integrate-a-yunio-service-with-power-automate/).

Note

When integrating services from a local yunIO installation with a cloud hosted platform like Power Automate, a gateway to tunnel the connection is recommended, e.g., the [**Microsoft On-premises data gateway**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/data-integration/gateway/). For more information about yunIO networking settings, see [yunIO Networking Scenarios](../networking/).

### Create a Power Automate Flow for Invoice Processing

The following workflow automatically extracts invoicing information with the AI Builder tool from random invoicing PDF files and posts this information to SAP.

1. Follow the steps described in the [Microsoft AI Builder Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/ai-builder/flow-invoice-processing) to create a new Power Automate flow that uses the invoice processing pre-built model of AI Builder.
1. Add an *Initialize variable* action after the AI Builder action. This variable is used to automatically convert extracted dates into an SAP compliant format.
1. Map the field *Invoice Date (Date)* returned from the AI Builder action to field *Value* of the *Initialize variable* action. For simplicity reasons this example uses only one date variable for the fields DOC_DATE, PSTNG_DATE and BLING_DATE.
1. Add the yunIO custom connector for incoming invoice creation.
1. Map the required output fields of the AI Builder action to the matching parameters of the custom connector. Keep in mind that some fields need fixed values required by SAP (INVOICESTATUS, INVOICE_IND,...), while others need output values from the invoice document extracted with the AI Builder action (DOC_DATE,...).\
   Because the table ITEMDATA is used in a BAPI that can process multiple invoice items, Power Automate automatically sets an *Apply to each* action as the next workflow step. This example demonstrates a simple case with a single invoice line item.
1. Use an expression to automatically convert the date fields into an SAP compliant format, see [Formats and Conversions in Power Automate](../conversion-in-power-automate/).
1. Optional: Add an email notification action to get notified about the newly created incoming invoice. Use the output parameters INVOICEDOCNUMBER and FISCALYEAR in the notification email to see if the invoice was successfully created. Other SAP output information (i.e. table RETURN) can be extracted to analyze the data in case of workflow failures.
1. Publish the workflow.

Note

Note that the values used in this example might not be valid for your SAP system. In your case other (fixed) values might be necessary to run the process.

### Test the Workflow

1. Upload a suitable invoice PDF-document. If needed, [download a sample EXCEL file (.xlsx)](../../assets/files/yunio/Invoice_Easy_Computer_Software-AI-Builder-Sample.xlsx) that can be used as an invoice document.\
   Note that a purchase order on which the incoming invoice can be booked, must already exist in the SAP ERP system. For more information on incoming invoices, see [SAP Help: Incoming Invoice](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_ERP/ffc393c91a904eb5b0bec93aa34e42d8/dc6eb6531de6b64ce10000000a174cb4.html?version=6.02.latest&locale=en-US).
1. Check if the workflow steps are successfully executed one after the other.
1. Check if an incoming invoice is created in SAP.

When a call to a yunIO REST service is made, there are several ways a request and response can travel through networks from the caller to the SAP system and back.\
This article provides examples of networking scenarios between a service caller and SAP.

### Same Network

If the service caller, yunIO and SAP are all part of the same network, the path for request and reponse is as follows:

1. The caller sends the request directly to the yunIO server via HTTP or HTTPS.
1. The yunIO server communicates with SAP. The response is sent back to the caller.

Examples:

- Caller, yunIO and SAP run on-premises.
- Caller, yunIO and SAP run in the same cloud environment.

### Different Networks

If the service caller is located on another network than yunIO and the SAP system, the two networks can be connected via the internet.

Examples:

- Caller is located in the cloud, yunIO and SAP run on-premises.
- Caller is located in the cloud, yunIO and SAP are located at a hosting provider.
- Caller is located in one cloud environment, yunIO and SAP are located in a different cloud environment.
- Caller is located on-premises, yunIO and SAP are located at a hosting provider.
- Caller is located on-premises, yunIO and SAP are located in the cloud.
- Caller is located in US branch office, yunIO and SAP are located in European headquarters.

Depending on the location of the caller, it is possible to restrict requests to the yunIO server to only trusted origins through network traffic rules. If that is not possible, requests to the yunIO server can be made from untrusted sources. This can be a security risk, even if authentication is enabled, e.g., denial-of-service attacks.

### Direct Connection

A direct connection can be established, if firewall rules allow incoming requests from the caller's network to the yunIO/SAP network. HTTPS should be enabled for direct connections to protect the confidentiality and integrity of the communication, see [yunIO Server Settings: Transport Layer Security](../../documentation/server-settings/#transport-layer-security). The ports for service calls and for accessing the designer are open, see [yunIO Server Settings: Services, Designer and WebSockets](../../documentation/server-settings/#services-designer-and-websockets).

For callers in cloud environments, it might not be possible to restrict requests to the yunIO server to trusted origins through firewall rules.

1. The caller sends the request directly to the yunIO server via HTTPS.
1. The yunIO server communicates with SAP. The response is sent back to the caller.

### Azure Relay

The yunIO service can be exposed to the caller through [Azure Relay](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/azure-relay/relay-what-is-it). For callers in cloud environments it might not be possible to restrict requests to the yunIO server to trusted origins through Azure Relay rules. In this scenario it is not necessary to change firewall rules of the yunIO/SAP network to allow incoming requests from other networks. Only outgoing requests from the yunIO/SAP network to Azure Relay must be allowed.

1. The yunIO server connects from the yunIO/SAP network to Azure Relay and establishes a secure tunnel.
1. a) The caller makes a request to Azure Relay.\
   b) The request is forwarded through the secure tunnel to the yunIO server.
1. The yunIO server communicates with SAP. The response is sent back to the caller.

For information on how to set up an Azure Relay Hybrid Connection with yunIO, see [Establish an Azure Relay Hybrid Connection to yunIO](../establish-an-azure-relay-hybrid-connection/).

### Azure VPN

The caller and yunIO/SAP can be connected through a secure tunnel and joined to the same VNet in Azure. The yunIO server can be protected from requests from untrusted sources by restricting access to the VNet in Azure. In this scenario it is not necessary to change firewall rules of the yunIO/SAP network to allow incoming requests from other networks. Only outgoing requests from the yunIO/SAP network to Azure must be allowed.

1. The VPN client connects from yunIO/SAP network to Azure, establishes the secure tunnel.
1. a) The caller makes a request to the yunIO server via VNet.\
   b) The request is forwarded through the secure tunnel to the yunIO/SAP network.\
   c) The request is forwarded to the yunIO server.
1. The yunIO server communicates with SAP. The response is sent back to the caller.

### Microsoft On-Premises Data Gateway

If the caller is one of the cloud services that is supported by the [on-premises data gateway](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/data-integration/gateway/service-gateway-onprem), requests to the yunIO server can be forwarded to the yunIO server through that gateway. The yunIO server can be protected from requests from untrusted sources using connection roles of the on-premises data gateway.\
Make sure that:

- the connectivity requirements from Microsoft are met, see [Adjust communication settings for the on-premises data gateway](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/data-integration/gateway/service-gateway-communication).
- the gateway and power platform region settings are identical, see [Check if the gateway is in the right region](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/troubleshoot/power-platform/power-automate/check-if-gateway-is-the-right-region).

In this scenario it is not necessary to change firewall rules of the yunIO/SAP network to allow incoming requests from other networks. Only outgoing requests from the yunIO/SAP network to Azure must be allowed.

1. The on-premises data gateway connects from yunIO/SAP network to Azure, establishes the secure tunnel.
1. a) The caller makes a request to the yunIO server via gateway resource.\
   b) The request is forwarded through the secure tunnel to the on-premises data gateway.\
   c) The request is forwarded to the yunIO server.
1. The yunIO server communicates with SAP. The response is sent back to the caller.

The following article shows how to use the Nintex [Employee Onboarding scenario template](https://gallery.nintex.com/t/employee-onboarding) with yunIO to create new employees in SAP.

### About

The [Employee Onboarding scenario template](https://gallery.nintex.com/t/employee-onboarding) provided by Nintex includes a form for filling in employee details. Based on the input, the workflow generates and sends the new hire their ‘Employee Contract’. Once the contract is signed, the workflow automatically stores the employee contract in a file storage system, starts user provisioning with Active Directory, and sends the new hire a welcome email.

This article leads you through all necessary steps to add a yunIO Xtension to the Employee Onboarding workflow to create the new employee in SAP.

### Setup in yunIO

yunIO is the connector that reads and writes data from and to SAP. For more information on yunIO, see [Theobald Software: yunIO](https://theobald-software.com/en/yunio/).

Note

The parameters that are needed to create new employees are dependent on your customized SAP settings.

1. [Create a service](../../getting-started/#create-a-service) in yunIO. The depicted example uses the integration type *Transaction* for the service.

1. Record SAP transactions to create a new employee in SAP, see [Transaction PA40 - Personnel Actions](../transaction-pa40/). Example:

1. Parameterize all mandatory SAP fields in the yunIO service. For information on how to parameterize services, see [Documentation: Parameterize Transactions](../../documentation/transactions/#parameterize-transactions). The depicted example uses the following input parameters:

   - *EntryDate*
   - *FirstName*
   - *LastName*
   - *BirthDate*
   - *BirthPlace*
   - *Language*
   - *Nationality*
   - *Street*
   - *City*
   - *PostalCode*

   The input parameters can be adjusted according to your individual scenario requirements.

1. Click to testrun the service in yunIO . For more information, see [Documentation: Run Services in yunIO](../../documentation/run-services/#run-services-in-yunio).

1. Click to download the service definition .

### Setup in Nintex

1. Integrate the yunIO service created in [Setup in yunIO](#setup-in-yunio) as an Xtension in Nintex, see [Integrate a yunIO Service with Nintex: Configure a yunIO Xtension in Nintex](../integrate-a-yunio-service-with-nintex/#configure-a-yunio-xtension-in-nintex).
1. Import the Nintex template for Employee Onboarding to your tenant, see [Nintex Gallery: Employee Onboarding](https://gallery.nintex.com/t/employee-onboarding).
1. Open the imported Nintex workflow.
1. Add the yunIO Xtension from step 1 after the contract is signed.
1. Edit the start form to include input fields for SAP (*EntryDate*, *FirstName*, *LastName*, *BirthDate*, *BirthPlace*, *Language*, *Nationality*, *Street*, *City*, *PostalCode*):
1. Create a new variable for every *Date/Time* field to change the date to the format "DD.MM.YYYY". This format is required by SAP.
1. Map the parameters of the input form to the input fields of the yunIO Xtension.
1. Optional: Add a **Log to instance details** action after the yunIO Xtension to monitor any returned error messages.
1. Test the workflow.

The following article shows how to integrate yunIO services with Microsoft Power Apps.\
Power Apps is a cloud-based platform to build custom business applications based on different data sources. For more Information on Power Apps, see [Microsoft Power Apps Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/).

### About

The following 3 examples for SAP interaction with drop down controls in Power Apps are documented in this article:

- Populating a drop down control with SAP table data without a search filter.
- Populating a drop down control with SAP table data using a search filter.
- Populating a drop down control with SAP data returned from a function module call.

### Setup in yunIO

1. The example applications in this article use multiple yunIO services. Create the following 3 services in yunIO:
   1. Create a Table service to query data from the SAP table MAKT with the following settings:\
      Select the table fields MATNR (Material Number), SPRAS (Language Key) and MAKTX (Material Description) for output. Set the row limit to 100 rows.
   1. Create a Table service to query data from the SAP table CSKT with the following settings:\
      Select the table fields KOSTL (Cost Center), KTEXT (General Name) and LTEXT (Description) for output. Set the row limit to 100 rows.
   1. Create a Function Module service that calls the function SD_RFC_CUSTOMER_GET with the following settings:\
      Set the input parameter NAME1 (Customer's Name) to *Supplied by caller*. Select all fields in the table *CUSTOMER_T* for the output.
1. Click to testrun the service in yunIO . For more information, see [Documentation: Run Services in yunIO](../../documentation/run-services/#run-services-in-yunio).
1. Click to download the service definition .

For more information on how to create services, see [Create a Service](../../getting-started/#create-a-service).

Note

In Power Apps every data source is limited to 500 items. Therefore, it is recommended to pre-filter requests to a manageable amount of data e.g., by using a row limit in the yunIO service.

### Configure a yunIO Custom Connector in Power Automate

To use the service created in [Setup in yunIO](#setup-in-yunio) with Power Apps, it must be available as a custom connector in Power Automate. For information on how to integrate a yunIO service with Power Automate, see [Integrate a yunIO Service with Power Automate](../integrate-a-yunio-service-with-power-automate/).

Note

When integrating services from a local yunIO installation with a cloud hosted platform like Power Automate, a gateway to tunnel the connection is recommended, e.g., the [**Microsoft On-premises data gateway**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/data-integration/gateway/). For more information about yunIO networking settings, see [yunIO Networking Scenarios](../networking/).

### Integrate yunIO Services in Power Apps

After a connector is successfully tested, it can be used as a data source in Power Apps.

Note

The Power Apps coding syntax is dependent on the configured language settings, e.g., the English `ClearCollect(SAPData,yunIO_1.ReadCSKT());` becomes `ClearCollect(SAPData;yunIO_1.ReadCSKT())` for German language users. For more information, see [Microsoft: Formula separators and chaining operator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/power-fx/global#formula-separators-and-chaining-operator).

1. Create a new model-driven Power App containing one screen using the Power Apps studio designer.
1. Add three drop down controls and three labels to describe the fields.
1. For the first and the last drop down control add additional text input controls (here *input_sap_material_number* and *input_customers*) for search/filter values.
1. Add the previously created yunIO custom connectors containing the MAKT service, the CSKT service and the CustomerGet service.
1. Customize the fields for populating the drop down controls with SAP values, see the examples below.

### Examples

The depicted examples show how to populate drop down lists with different kinds of data.

The first example queries SAP table data for table CSKT (Cost Center Texts). The drop down control is populated without any search filtering.

1. Use the following code in the *OnSelect* box of the dropdown control in the advanced settings:

   ```text
   ClearCollect(SAPData,yunIO_1.ReadCSKT());

   ```

   With *ClearCollect* a collection with a name of your choice (here *SAPData*) is filled with data from the external data source. The results are displayed when unfolding the drop down control.

1. Use the *Concatenate* function in the field *Items* to concatenate and display more than one table column in the drop down control. The result of the SAP table query, stored in the collection variable *SAPData*, is displayed in the *Value* box as *Result*. In this example the fields KOSTL (cost center) and LTEXT (cost center description) are concatenated and displayed, separated by a space. Other column separators are possible.

   ```text
   Concatenate(SAPData.KOSTL," ",SAPData.LTEXT)

   ```

Tip

You can display a quick preview in the Power Apps studio by clicking **[Alt] + the drop down control**.

The second example queries SAP table data for table MAKT (Material Descriptions). The search field uses a Where Clause to filter the SAP table.

1. Use the following code in the *OnSelect* box of the drop down control in the advanced settings:

   ```text
   ClearCollect(SAPResult,yunIO.MAKTService({whereClause:Concatenate("SPRAS = 'EN' AND MATNR LIKE '",input_sap_material_number.Text,"'")}));

   ```

   With *ClearCollect* a collection with a name of your choice (here *SAPResult*) is filled with data from the external data source. The Where Clause points to the input field *input_sap_material_number* (configured as Text).

1. Use the *Concatenate* function in the field *Items* to concatenate and display more than one table column in the drop down control. The result of the SAP table query, stored in the collection variable *SAPResult*, is displayed in the *Value* box as *Result*. In this example the fields MATNR (material number) and MAKTX (material description are concatenated and displayed, separated by a space. Other column separators are possible.

   ```text
   Concatenate(SAPResult.MATNR," ",SAPResult.MAKTX)  

   ```

Tip

You can also use the *OnChange* field of the text input control for the *ClearCollect* statement. This has the advantage that the drop down control is populated while the search text is entered.

**Ignoring Leading Zeroes:**\
To ignore leading zeroes when using the search filter for MAKT, use the following code for the *ClearCollect* statement:

```text
ClearCollect(SAPResult;yunIO.MAKTService({whereClause:Concatenate("SPRAS = 'DE' AND ( MATNR LIKE '";Substitute(input_sap_material_number.Text;"*";"%");"' OR MAKTX LIKE '";Substitute(input_sap_material_number.Text;"*";"%");"' )")}));;
If(CountRows(SAPResult)=1;Set(varinput_sap_material_number;false)

```

The third example calls the SAP function module SD_RFC_CUSTOMER_GET using an input parameter to display the table output (table CUSTOMER_T) in the drop down control. The input parameter is passed to the function by a separate text input control. In this example the text input control enables searching for customer names (field NAME1).

1. Use the following code in the *OnSelect* box of the drop down control in the advanced settings:

   ```text
   ClearCollect(CustomerGetResult,yunIO_2.postCustomerGet({NAME1:input_customer_name.Text}).CUSTOMER_T);

   ```

   With *ClearCollect* a collection with a name of your choice (her *CustomerGetResult*) is filled with data from the external data source. The input parameter NAME1 points to the text input control *input_customer_name*. There is a reference to the output table CUSTOMER_T at the end of the statement, which allows to select the output fields of that table later on.

1. Use the *Concatenate* function in the field *Items* to concatenate and display more then one table column in the drop down control. The result of the SAP table query, stored in the collection variable *CustomerGetResult*, is displayed in the *Value* box as *Result*. In this example fields NAME1 (customer name) and KUNNR (customer number) are concatenated and displayed, separated by a space. Other column separators are possible.

   ```text
   Concatenate(CustomerGetResult.NAME1," ",CustomerGetResult.KUNNR)

   ```

This article shows how to synchronize a Salesforce account in near-real time with SAP.\
In the following scenario, data from Salesforce is used to automatically create a customer account in SAP. The newly created SAP customer number is then written back to Salesforce.

### About

This article leads you through all necessary steps to set up the following process:

- When an account in the *Sales Console* of Salesforce is modified, a Power Automate workflow is triggered.
- The workflow checks if the type of the account is set to *Customer - Direct* and if the customer exists in SAP.
- If both conditions are true, a yunIO service that writes customer data from Salesforce to SAP is executed.
- When the customer is created in SAP, the new SAP customer number is written back to the Salesforce sales account.

### Setup in yunIO

yunIO is the connector that reads and writes data from and to SAP. For more information on yunIO, see [Theobald Software: yunIO](https://theobald-software.com/en/yunio/).

1. [Create an SAP connection](../../getting-started/#create-a-service) in yunIO.
1. [Create a service](../../getting-started/#create-a-service) in yunIO. The depicted example uses the integration type *Function Module* for the service.
1. [Look up](../../documentation/function-modules-and-bapis/#look-up-a-function-module-bapi) the standard BAPI BAPI_CUSTOMER_CREATEFROMDATA1 that creates customers in SAP.
1. Set all import parameters you want to transfer from Salesforce to SAP to *Supplied by Caller* e.g., NAME, CITY, POSTL_COD1, STREET, etc.
1. Select CUSTOMERNO for export. This Export parameter contains the newly created SAP customer number that is written back to Salesforce.
1. Click to testrun the service in yunIO . For more information, see [Documentation: Run Services in yunIO](../../documentation/run-services/#run-services-in-yunio).
1. Click to download the service definition .

### Setup in Salesforce

Customize your Salesforce account to provide SAP-related fields:

- Create a field *SAP ID*. Once a customer is created in SAP, the customer number is written back into *SAP ID*.
- *Company Code*, *Sales Org*, *Distribution Channel* and *Division* are organization details required to create the SAP customer.
- Create a checkbox that indicates if the customer exists in SAP.

For more information on how to customize fields in Salesforce, see [Salesforce Documentation: Create Custom Fields](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.adding_fields.htm&type=5).

Note

Creating *Company Code*, *Sales Org*, *Distribution Channel* and *Division* in Salesforce is optional as they can also be set as static values in Power Automate.

### Setup in Power Automate

1. Integrate the yunIO service created in [Setup in yunIO](#setup-in-yunio) as a Custom Connector in Power Automate, see [Integrate a yunIO Service with Power Automate](../integrate-a-yunio-service-with-power-automate/#configure-a-yunio-custom-connector-in-power-automate).
1. Create a new workflow that is triggered when a Salesforce account is modified .
1. Check if the account type in Salesforce is set to *Customer - Direct* and if the customer does not yet exist in SAP .\
   If one or both conditions are false, end the workflow . If both conditions are true, execute the yunIO service to write the customer data to SAP .
1. Add the yunIO connector created in step 1 to the workflow and map the customer data from Salesforce to the input parameters of yunIO.
1. Check if the SAP customer was created using the yunIO return field TYPE .\
   If TYPE does not equal 'E' (error), the SAP customer number is written back to Salesforce.
1. When updating the Salesforce account, assign the CUSTOMERNO from yunIO to *SAP ID* and set the checkbox *In SAP* to 'Yes' .
1. Optional: Send notifications when a customer is created or log all synchronized Salesforce accounts e.g., in a SharePoint Online list.
1. Turn on the workflow.

### Trigger the Process

1. Open Salesforce and change the account type from *Prospect* to *Customer - Direct*. Make sure that the checkbox *In SAP* is deactivated.
1. The Power Automate workflow runs and creates the customer in SAP.
1. Check if the SAP customer number is set in Salesforce and if the checkbox *In SAP* is active.
1. Open SAP and look up the customer using the transaction **xd03**. Enter the customer number from Salesforce to look up the customer.

The following article illustrates the extraction mechanism of the *SAP Table and View* integration type.

### Table Extraction Process

The extraction mechanism of Table includes the following processes:

- Lookup process to read SAP metadata for the definition of the Table extraction.
- Configuration of the *SAP Table and View* integration type definition.
- Execution of the asynchron data loading process.

The depicted graphic illustrates the mechanism in both yunIO and in SAP. Click the graphic to zoom in.

The following article shows how to use forms in Microsoft Teams to send data to SAP.\
In the following scenario, a Teams form is used to transfer an employee's sick leave request to SAP.

### About

This article leads you through all necessary steps to set up the following process:

- When a sick leave is requested via a Microsoft Teams form, a Power Automate workflow is triggered.
- The workflow starts an approval process.
- The workflow runs a yunIO service that transfers the details of the sick leave to SAP.

### Setup in yunIO

yunIO is the connector that reads and writes data from and to SAP. For more information on yunIO, see [Theobald Software: yunIO](https://theobald-software.com/en/yunio/).\
Follow the steps below to set up a yunIO service that creates sick leaves in SAP:

Note

Every type of sick leave requires a designated yunIO service. It is not possible to cover multiple types of sick leave in a single service, because of varying input screens.

Note

The parameters that are needed to create a sick leave are dependent on your customized SAP settings.

1. [Create an SAP connection](../../getting-started/#connect-to-sap) in yunIO.
1. [Create a service](../../getting-started/#create-a-service) in yunIO. The depicted example uses the integration type *Transaction* for the service.
1. Record the SAP transaction PA30 to create a new sick leave in SAP, e.g., for an annual sick leave (*Infotype* 2001 and *STy* 0100).
1. Set parameters for the following input options. For more information on how to parameterize transactions, see [Documentation: Parameterize Transactions](../../documentation/transactions/#parameterize-transactions).
   - Employee number
   - Start date of the sick leave
   - End date of the sick leave
1. Click **[Save]** to save the service.
1. Click to testrun the service in yunIO . For more information, see [Documentation: Run Services in yunIO](../../documentation/run-services/#run-services-in-yunio).
1. Click to download the service definition .
1. Repeat steps 3 to 7 to create a service for every relevant type of sick leave:
   - Illness with certificate (*Infotype* 2001 and *STy* 0200)
   - Parental leave (*Infotype* 2001 and *STy* 0600)
   - Unpaid leave (*Infotype* 2001 and *STy* 0620)
   - Sick child (*Infotype* 2001 and *STy* 0550).

### Setup in Microsoft Teams

The setup in Teams requires the installation of the Teams app [Team Forms](https://teamforms.app/) from the Microsoft Teams app store.

1. Open the Team Forms template "Sick Leave Request".

1. Open the editor for the mandatory input field **Leave type**.

1. Navigate to the tab *Data* and edit the labels and values of **Leave type** to provide the following SAP input:

   | Leave Type | Value | | --- | --- | | Annual Leave | 0100 | | Illness with certificate | 0200 | | Parental Leave | 0600 | | Unpaid Leave | 0620 | | Sick child (unpaid) | 0550 |

1. Click **[Save]** to save the changes.

1. Optional: Further edit the form to fit the requirements of your organization.

1. Click **[Publish]** to make the form available to your team.

For more information on Team Forms, see [Team Forms Documentation](https://docs.teamforms.app/).

### Setup in Power Automate

1. Integrate the yunIO services created in [Setup in yunIO](#setup-in-yunio) as Custom Connectors in Power Automate, see [Integrate a yunIO Service with Power Automate](../integrate-a-yunio-service-with-power-automate/#configure-a-yunio-custom-connector-in-power-automate).

1. Create a new workflow that is triggered when a new Team form is submitted.

1. Optional: Add an approval process for the leave request to the workflow.

1. Add a *Switch* action to the workflow that queries the value of the leave type defined in the Team form .

1. Add the corresponding yunIO connector created in step 1 for each each leave type .

1. Map the data from the Team form to the input parameters of yunIO .

1. Make sure the input uses the right format, e.g., dates use the format `DD.mm.YYYY`.

   Tip

   The following code reformats dates returned by the Teams form from `yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss*SSSZZZZ` to `DD.mm.YYYY`:

   ```text
   #Start date:
   concat(substring(triggerOutputs()?['body/data/startDate'], 8, 2), '.', substring(triggerOutputs()?['body/data/startDate'], 5, 2), '.', substring(triggerOutputs()?['body/data/startDate'], 0, 4))
   #End date:
   concat(substring(triggerOutputs()?['body/data/endDate'], 8, 2), '.', substring(triggerOutputs()?['body/data/endDate'], 5, 2), '.', substring(triggerOutputs()?['body/data/endDate'], 0, 4))

   ```

1. Optional: Send notifications when a sick leave is requested.

1. Turn on the workflow.

### Trigger the Process

1. Open the Teams form and fill out the details of your sick leave.\
   Enter the SAP employee number, select the leave type and the start and end date of the sick leave.
1. Submit the Teams form.
1. The Power Automate workflow runs and transfers the details of the sick leave to SAP.

With yunIO, developers are furnished with an exceptional instrument for crafting applications tailored for SharePoint Online/Office 365 as well as other cloud-based or traditional environments.

yunIO is adaptable and accommodates applications developed in any programming language with the ability to interact with REST API.

The package incorporates a JavaScript library for REST.

For optimum results when developing with yunIO REST Services utilizing JavaScript, it is highly recommended to make use of our proprietary JavaScript library. This library streamlines client-side programming by encapsulating various yunIO-specific functionalities.

The following article shows how to install an X.509 certificate for transport encryption.\
The installation of an X.509 certificate is required to use [Transport Layer Security (TLS)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthn/transport-layer-security-protocol) and secure authentication with yunIO.

### About X.509 Certificates

There are two main approaches for creating an X.509 certificate:

- Certificate released by an (internal) certification authority (CA)
- Self-signed certificate

On test environments you can use a self-signed certificate. For production environment it is recommended to use a certificate released by an (internal) certificate authority (CA).

### Create and Import the X.509 Certificate

Make sure to have a TLS certificate issued by your IT network team considering the following points:

1. The certificate property “Subject Alternative Name” contains the DNS name of the server that runs the yunIO Windows service. When activating TLS, the *Subject Alternative Name* is used as the new hostname.
1. The certificate common name (CN) attribute contains the DNS name of the server. To display the Common Name (CN) of the certificate, double-click the certificate in the Cetrificate Manager and navigate to the *Details* tab.
1. Import the certificate to the [Windows Certificate Store](<https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/ms788967(v=vs.91)>) of the machine, that runs the yunIO Windows service using the Microsoft Management Console (mmc.exe). The depicted example uses the server name "TODD":
1. Right-click the certificate and navigate to **All Tasks > Manage private keys** to add a new permission entry for the Windows user that runs the yunIO Windows service.
1. Enter the object name "NT Service\\yunIO Service" and click **[Check Names]** before applying the changes.

The certificate is now available on your machine. For information on how to renew a certificate, see [Certificate Renewal for TLS](../certificate-renewal/).

Note

The Windows Certificate Store works with most browsers. NMozilla Firefox offers its own certificate storage. Configure your Firefox browser to trust certificates in the Windows certificate store or import the certificate via an enterprise policy, see [Mozilla Support: Setting Up Certificate Authorities (CAs) in Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/setting-certificate-authorities-firefox).

### Integrate the X.509 Certificate

1. Import the certificate to the Windows Certificate Store using Microsoft Management Console (mmc). In the example shown, the server name is "sherri":
1. Open the yunIO Designer and navigate to the *Settings* menu.
1. Click **[Pick Certificate]** to reference the X.509 certificate.\
   Information about the currently saved certificate is displayed in the Transport Layer Security section of the menu.
1. Click **Enable TLS** to activate Transport Layer Security, see [Documentation: Server Settings](../../documentation/server-settings/).
1. Click **[Save]** and restart the yunIO Windows service to implement the changes.

The yunIO Designer and the services created in yunIO are now accessible via https protocol.

The following article shows how to use yunIO with Microsoft Power Automate to create multiple items in SAP with one service call. Power Automate is a cloud-based process automation service provided by Microsoft. For more Information on Power Automate see [Microsoft Power Automate Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-automate/).

### About

The depicted example scenario creates multiple cost centers in the SAP cost center master data. This article guides you through the following process:

- Create a yunIO service that can handle multiple input values.
- Create multiple data sets and that can be used as an input for the yunIO service.\
  In this example, multiple items are passed to the SAP function via an Excel spreadsheet. Other options are SharePoint lists, a Power App with *Gallery Control* for multiple line items, a Nintex Form with a repeating section and others.
- Create a Power Automate workflow that reads and processes data from the input table to run the yunIO service.

### Setup in yunIO

Create a yunIO service that creates cost centers in the SAP cost center master data.

Note

The parameters that are needed to create cost centers are dependent on your customized SAP settings.

1. [Create a service](../../getting-started/#create-a-service) in yunIO. For this example we use the BAPI_COSTCENTER_CREATEMULTIPLE to create multiple cost centers in SAP.
1. Activate **Commit Transaction** in the *Advanced Settings* of the service. This option is mandatory when using BAPI_COSTCENTER_CREATEMULTIPLE.
1. Set the Import Parameter CONTROLLINGAREA to *Supplied by Caller*.
1. Select the table *RETURN* for the output. The data in this table can be used for exception handling.
1. Set the following items of the table COSTCENTERLIST to *Supplied by Caller*:

### Configure a yunIO Custom Connector in Power Automate

To use the service created in [Setup in yunIO](#setup-in-yunio) with Power Apps, it must be available as a custom connector in Power Automate. For information on how to integrate a yunIO service with Power Automate, see [Integrate a yunIO Service with Power Automate](../integrate-a-yunio-service-with-power-automate/).

Note

When integrating services from a local yunIO installation with a cloud hosted platform like Power Automate, a gateway to tunnel the connection is recommended, e.g., the [**Microsoft On-premises data gateway**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/data-integration/gateway/). For more information about yunIO networking settings, see [yunIO Networking Scenarios](../networking/).

### Create Input Data

- Create data sets that include values for all fields in the table COSTCENTERLIST that are set to *Supplied by Caller* in the yunIO service. If needed, download the sample EXCEL file below.
- Upload the data sets to the SharePoint document library or any other location that is accessible for Power Automate.

### Create a Power Automate Flow for Multiple Items

The following workflow reads and processes data from a table and to create new cost centers in the SAP cost center master data.

1. Create a new workflow.

1. Add a manual trigger to test the workflow when necessary.

1. Add a List rows present in table action to read the input data for the yunIO service. In this example, the data is hosted on SharePoint, see [Create Input Data](#create-input-data).

1. Add an *Initialize variable* action to create an array that can store multiple items. Leave **Value** empty.

1. Add an *Apply to each* action to incrementally fill the initialized array with input data. Select the list of items from the SharePoint table as the input for the *Apply to each* action.

1. Add a *Compose* action to *Apply to each*. Use *Compose* to create the body of the yunIO web service that contains the table parameters and to map the input data.

   ```text
   {
     "COSTCENTER": "",
     "VALID_FROM": "",
     "VALID_TO": "",
     "PERSON_IN_CHARGE": "",
     "COSTCENTER_TYPE": "",
     "COSTCTR_HIER_GRP": "",
     "COMP_CODE": "",
     "PROFIT_CTR": "",
     "NAME": ""
   }

   ```

1. Add an *Append to array variable* action to *Apply to each*. Select the initialized array and add the output of the *Compose* action to **Value**.

1. Add the yunIO custom connector for creating cost centers after the *Apply to each* action.\
   Enter a value for the import parameter CONTROLLINGAREA and assign the filled array variable to the table parameter COSTCENTERLIST.

1. Optional: Add an email notification action to get notified about the newly created cost centers.

1. Test the workflow.\
   Check if the workflow steps are successfully executed one after the other.\
   Check if the cost centers from the input data sets are created in SAP (table CSKS).
