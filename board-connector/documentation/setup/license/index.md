### About the Licensing Concept of Board Connector

Board Connector is licensed per Windows server. The license is bound to your company and a specific server name. If you run the Board Connector Designer and the Board Connector Server on different machines, it is only necessary to replace the license on the server.

A trial license is automatically installed with the installation of Board Connector.\
A regular license is provided in the [customer portal - My Theobald Software](https://my.theobald-software.com/) after purchasing the product.

### Install the Board Connector License

Place the "BOARDConnectorLicense.json" file that is provided in the [Customer Portal - My Theobald Software](https://my.theobald-software.com) into the installation directory on the server, e.g., `C:\Program Files\BOARDConnector`.

Tip

To inspect your current license data, open the Board Connector Designer and navigate to **[Help] > [Info]** in the main menu bar. Alternatively, press **[F12]**.

### Move a License to a new Server

When moving your setup to a new server, a new license file must be issued for that server. Contact our sales team at [sales@theobald-software.com](mailto:sales@theobald-software.com) to let us know the name of the new server.

For more information on the migration process, see [Migration to a Different Machine](../migration/#migration-to-a-different-machine).
