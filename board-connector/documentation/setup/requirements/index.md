- SAP industry solutions like IS-U, IS-R, etc. are supported.
- SAP releases 4.6C and newer are supported.
- All operating systems are supported.

**Disclaimer**

While SAP versions that are no longer supported by SAP still work with Theobald Software products, they are excluded from the Theobald Software support service.

#### Not Supported SAP Systems

The following SAP Systems are not supported:

- SAP systems that don't provide RFC connectivity.

Examples

### HANA Database

You can use Operational Data Provisioning (ODP) to connect the SAP HANA database of an SAP ABAP source system. Communication is done via RFC. With the ODP context for SAP HANA (HANA) the following HANA View types are available for extracting:

- Analysis Views
- Calculation Views
- Associated Attribute Views

Direct access to a HANA database without an SAP ABAP source system running on the corresponding HANA database is not supported.

### Ports

The following ports between the Windows server that runs Board Connector and the SAP server, must be open:

| SAP NetWeaver Component | Port (NN = System number of the SAP system) | | --- | --- | | SAP Application Server | 33<NN> | | SAP Message Server | 36<NN> | | Secure Network Communication (SNC) | 48<NN> | | SAP-Router | 3299 |
