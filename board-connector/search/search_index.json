When distributing network traffic caused by Board Connector, it is necessary to use a load balancer between different Windows servers that run the Board Connector.</p> <p>Typical use cases for load balancing include:</p> <ul> <li>Improved Performance: By distributing network traffic across multiple Board Connector servers, a load balancer can significantly improve the performance of your network.  This can be especially important for high-traffic applications that require fast and reliable access.</li> <li>Increased Reliability: Load balancing can help increase the reliability of your network by ensuring that no one Board Connector server becomes overloaded with traffic.  This helps to prevent downtime and ensures that your network is always available.</li> <li>Scalability: A load balancer can also help improve the scalability of your network by allowing you to easily add or remove Board Connector servers as needed.  This can be important for businesses that experience sudden spikes in traffic.</li> <li>Centralized Management: A load balancer allows you to manage multiple servers from a single location.  This makes it easier to monitor your network, troubleshoot issues, and make necessary adjustments.</li> <li>Parallel Processing: A load balancer allows running multiple extractions at the same time on different servers.
