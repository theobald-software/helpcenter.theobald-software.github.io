This section contains information about system requirements and compatible SAP systems for ERPConnect.

### .NET Framework

ERPConnect (without LINQ to ERP) consists of two .NET assemblies that [target different frameworks](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/dotnet/standard/frameworks):

- ERPConnect35.dll (targets .NET Framework 3.5 SP1)

That results in the following compatibility matrix:

| | ERPConnectStandard20.dll | ERPConnect35.dll | | --- | --- | --- | | .NET Framework 3.5 SP1 | | X | | .NET Framework 4.0 | | X | | .NET Framework 4.5 | | X | | .NET Framework 4.5.1 | | X | | .NET Framework 4.5.2 | | X | | .NET Framework 4.6 | | X | | .NET Framework 4.6.1 and newer | X | X | | .NET Core 2.0 and newer | X | X | | Universal Windows Platform 10.0.16299 and newer | X | |
