Detection will take the following steps to map fields with matching names:\n\n1. Primary keys that directly reference another table\n2. Primary keys that both reference the same table which does not exist in the extraction\n3. All fields that directly reference another table\n4. All fields that both reference the same table which does not exist in the extraction\n\n### Bug fixes\n- fixed a bug where editing of joins was not possible after saving an extraction"
