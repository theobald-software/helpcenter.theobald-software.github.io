Should the authority check fail and the report is assigned to an authorization group, another authority check on S_PROGRAM is performed. If both authority checks fail, the extraction is aborted with an error.\n- *IMPORTANT:* Reports not assigned to an authorization group can't be extracted anymore without having an appropriate Z_TS_PROG authorization object assigned to user."
