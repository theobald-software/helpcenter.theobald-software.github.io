This allows SSO on SAP systems and SQL server destinations from various clients including the *Alteryx Plugin* and *xu.exe*. \n\nFor security reasons this feature requires the usage of *HTTPS*. Using **\"Require SAP credentials to be explicitly supplied for execution\"** also requires *HTTPS* now, which is a breaking change."
