        "ReleaseNote": "# Xtract Universal 3.7.0\n\nThe **ABAP** subdirectory now contains the following transport requests:\n\n### Z_THEO_READ_TABLE.zip\nTransport request for new table custom function module *Z_THEO_READ_TABLE*. This is the successor to *Z_XTRACT_IS_TABLE_COMPRESSION*.\nThe old table function module *Z_XTRACT_IS_TABLE_COMPRESSION* will continue to work with our products, but is no longer being maintained. Please consider adjusting your table extractions to use *Z_THEO_READ_TABLE* instead of *Z_XTRACT_IS_TABLE_COMPRESSION*.\nThis version of the transport request requires SAP Release 7.40 SP05 or later and supports sub-selects in WHERE-clauses.\n\n### Z_THEO_READ_TABLE-before_740SP05.zip\nSame as above, but for SAP Releases older than 7.40 SP05. This version does not support sub-selects in WHERE-clauses.\n\n### thtrans.zip\nTransport request for Report component custom function *Z_XTRACT_IS_REMOTE_REPORT* and Table Join component custom function *Z_XTRACT_IS_TABLE_JOIN*. This transport request no longer contains *Z_XTRACT_IS_TABLE_COMPRESSION*, since it has been deprecated. Please use *Z_THEO_READ_TABLE* instead."
