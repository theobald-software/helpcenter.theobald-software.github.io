        "ReleaseNote": "# Xtract Universal 3.12\n\n## Text Encodings for *HTTP - CSV*, *Flat File - CSV* and *OData Atom* destinations\n\nThe large list of legacy encodings has been replaced with the following:\n\n* UTF-8\n* UTF-16LE\n* UTF-16BE\n* GB18030\n\nIt seems that these encodings should cover most common use cases. **If you have requirements for special encodings, that are not available anymore, please contact support.**\n\n\n## Byte Order Marks / Preambles and *xu.exe* output redirection\n\nThe encodings listed above are used without preamble / BOM in *HTTP - CSV* and *OData Atom*. The *Flat File - CSV* destination on the other hand, uses preambles / BOMs. When redirecting standard output of *xu.exe* (e. g. to a file), preambles / BOMs will be used.\n\n## Updated to .NET Framework 4.6.1\n\nThe target framework of all components has been updated from 4.5.2 to 4.6.1. **That means, you need .NET Framework 4.6.1 or higher to run Xtract Universal.**"
