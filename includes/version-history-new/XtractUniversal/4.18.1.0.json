        "ReleaseNote": "## Retry logic for cloud storage destinations.\n\nImplemented retry logic for web requests in Azure Storage destination and in AWS S3 destination. Now when Azure Storage destination or AWS S3 destination send a request to the API during an upload, if the request fails, it will be resent. The delay between each retry grows exponentially, starting at 1 second. Maximum delay is 60 seconds, after which the extraction fails.\n\nThis change will prevent extractions from failing due to transient faults in connection between Xtract Universal and S3 / Azure Storage or short service downtimes in the cloud environemnts.\n\n### More technical information:\n\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/api-reference/handling-errors/\n\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/best-practices/retry-service-specific#general-rest-and-retry-guidelines"
