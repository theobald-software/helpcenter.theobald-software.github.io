### HANA Database
You can use Operational Data Provisioning (ODP) to connect the SAP HANA database of an SAP ABAP source system. 
Communication is done via RFC. 
With the ODP context for SAP HANA (HANA) the following HANA View types are available for extracting:
- Analysis Views
- Calculation Views
- Associated Attribute Views

Direct access to a HANA database without an SAP ABAP source system running on the corresponding HANA database is not supported.
