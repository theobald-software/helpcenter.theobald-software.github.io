### Folder

Writes the extracted data to a specific folder structure within the {{ page.meta.location }}.
If the specified folder does not exist, it is created.

- Create a single folder by entering a folder name without slashes: `[folder]` <br>
- Create subfolders using the following syntax: `[folder]/[subfolder_1]/[subfolder_2]/[..]`

!!! note
	The specified folder path only applies to the selected extraction. 
	To define a folder path for all extractions, use the **Folder path** option in the [Destination Details](#destination-details).
