### File Name

Determines the name of the target table. The following options are available:

| Option | Description |
|---------|-----------|
| **Same as name of SAP object** | Copy the name of the SAP object. |
| **Same as name of extraction** | Adopt the name of the extraction. |
| **Fully qualified extraction name** | Adopt the name of the extraction, including the path of the extraction. This option avoids conflicts, when the extraction names are not unique. Use the fully qualified extraction name when the same extraction name is used in multiple [extraction groups](../organize-extractions.md).|

#### Append timestamp
Add the timestamp in the UTC format (_YYYY_MM_DD_hh_mm_ss_fff) to the file name of the extraction
