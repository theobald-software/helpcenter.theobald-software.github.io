The following article shows how to set up Single Sign-On (SSO) with Secure Network Communication (SNC) and External ID.<br>
*SSO with External ID* uses a Personal Security Environment (PSE) to create a trust relationship between the SAP application server and the service account that runs {{ productName }}.
This allows {{ productName }} to impersonate any SAP user.<br>

### Requirements

The usage of *SSO with External ID* requires:
- The {{ productName }} service must run under a Windows AD Service account, see [Run the {{ productName }} Service under a Windows Service Account](../documentation/setup/service-account.md).
- Set up access restrictions for the {{ productName }} Designer and the {{ Abbr }} server, see [Restrict Access to Windows AD Users (Kerberos Authentication)](../documentation/access-restrictions/restrict-server-access.md/#restrict-access-to-windows-ad-users-kerberos-authentication).<br>
- Windows AD users must be mapped to SAP users in the SAP table USRACL, see [SAP Help: User Authentication and Single Sign-On](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_NETWEAVER_750/e815bb97839a4d83be6c4fca48ee5777/e54344b6d24a05408ca4faa94554e851.html?locale=en-US). <!---[SAP Help: Mapping Windows Users to SAP Users for Kerberos SSO](https://help.sap.com/saphelp_ewm900/helpdata/en/44/0efeafb9920d1be10000000a114a6b/frameset.htm)--->
- The SAP CommonCryptoLib must be installed on the machine that runs {{ productName }}, see [SAP Note 1848999](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/1848999).<br>
Copy the library (sapcrypto.dll) and the command line tool (sapgenpse.exe) to a local directory, e.g. `C:\PSE\`.
For more information, see [SAP Help: Downloading and Installing the SAP Cryptographic Library](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_IDENTITY_MANAGEMENT/4773a9ae1296411a9d5c24873a8d418c/3d4ece540ae64e30997498025e37f686.html?locale=en-US).
- The environment variables SECUDIR and SNC_LIB must be set to the PSE directory that contains the SAP CommonCryptoLib.

For more information on PSE, see [SAP Documentation: Creating PSEs and Maintaining the PSE Infrastructure](https://help.sap.com/doc/saphelp_nw73ehp1/7.31.19/en-us/59/6b653a0c52425fe10000000a114084/frameset.htm).

### The Process

SSO with External ID uses an X.509 certificate & PSE to create a trust relationship between the SAP application server and the service account that runs {{ productName }}.
This allows {{ productName }} to impersonate any SAP user.

![sap-external-id](../assets/images/{{ abbr }}/articles/sso/sso-with-external-id.png){:class="img-responsive" width="700px"}

1. Users authenticate themselves against {{ productName }} via Active Directory (Kerberos) and request data from SAP.
2. {{ productName }} opens an RFC connection via SNC and uses PSE & External ID for authentication.
3. {{ productName }} reads the SAP table USRACL to determine the SAP user that is mapped to the Active Directory user from step 1.
4. {{ productName }} then impersonates the mapped SAP user to request the SAP data via SNC.
5. {{ productName }} retrieves the requested SAP data with the privileges of the caller.
6. {{ productName }} loads the extracted SAP data to the tool that triggered the extraction.


### Setup in SAP

1. Use the SAPGENPSE command line tool to generate an X.509 certificate for the Windows service account that runs {{ productName }}. <br>
Use the following command to create the certificate: 
``` console
sapgenpse gen_pse -p theo-{{ abbr }}.pse
```
The distinguished name of the PSE owner can be the fully qualified hostname of the {{ productName }} server, e.g., `CN={{ abbr }}server.example.com`. 
2. Use the the following command to export the certificate:
``` console
sapgenpse export_own_cert -v -p theo-{{ abbr }}.pse -o theo-{{ abbr }}.crt
```
3. Use SAP transaction STRUST to add the certificate to the list of trusted PSE certificates, see [SAP Help: Adding Certificates to PSE Certificate Lists](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_NETWEAVER_750/280f016edb8049e998237fcbd80558e7/798e9421e00b4dc1ade3d4199ac60837-35.html?locale=en-US).
4. Use SAP transaction SNC0 to create an access control list item that allows RFC and external IDs for the Common Name (CN) of the certificate created in step 1.<br>
![sap-external-id](../assets/images/articles/sso/sap-external-id.png){:class="img-responsive"}
5. Use SAP transaction STRUST to export the server certificate of the SAP server, see [SAP Help: Exporting the AS ABAP's Public-Key Certificate](https://help.sap.com/saphelp_SNC700_ehp01/helpdata/en/47/d84e3c719d1742e10000000a11405a/frameset.htm).
6. Copy the exported server certificate to the PSE directory of the machine that runs {{ productName }}.
7. Use the SAPGENPSE command line tool to import the server certificate to the client PSE. Example: 
``` console
sapgenpse maintain_pk -v -a server.crt -p theo-{{ abbr }}.pse
```
8. Use the following command to create a credentials file (cred_v2), see [SAP Help: Creating the Server's Credentials Using SAPGENPSE](https://help.sap.com/saphelp_snc70/helpdata/en/32/ce2e3ad962a51ae10000000a11402f/frameset.htm). 
``` console
sapgenpse seclogin -p theo-{{ abbr }}.pse â€“O SAPServiceUser
```
The credentials file gives {{ productName }} access to the PSE without providing the password for the PSE.

The PSE directory should now contain the following files:
- the client PSE `theo-{{ abbr }}.pse`
- the client certificate `theo-{{ abbr }}.crt`
- the server certificate that was exported from your SAP system `[server].crt`
- the credentials file `cred_v2`

### Setup in {{ productName }}

Create a new SAP source system in your {{ productName }} to set up SSO with External ID:

1. Navigate to **[Server > Manage Sources]** in the main menu of the Designer. The window "Manage Sources" opens.
2. Click **[Add]** to create a new SAP source.
3. Open the tab *General* and enter the connection details of your SAP system.
4. Open the tab *Authentication* and activate the option **Secure Network Communications (SNC)**.<br>
![sso-certificate-auth](../assets/images/articles/sso/sso-external-id-source.png){:class="img-responsive"}
5. Enter the name of an SAP user in the field **User** for the initial login with {{ productName }}. <br>
This user must be a technical user (SAP user with security policy set to *Technical User*) and must have privileges to read the SAP table USRACL via the function module RFC_READ_TABLE. 
6. Enter the complete path to the SAP cryptographic library in the field **SNC Library**, e.g. `C:\PSE\sapcrypto.dll`.
7. Enter the SPN of the SAP service account in the field **SNC partner name**. Use the following notation: `p:[SPN]@[Domain-FQDN-Uppercase]`. 
8. Enable the option **SSO - Log in as caller via External ID**.
9. Click **[Test Connection]** to verify your connection settings.
10. Click **[OK]** to save your changes.
