### Add an {{ table }} {{ Component }}

Follow the steps below to add an {{ table }} {{ component }} to your {{ extraction }}:

1. Drag&drop the {{ page.meta.componentName }} {{ component }} from the SSIS toolbox into your data flow task.<br>
![New](../../assets/images/xis/documentation/{{ page.meta.componentFolder }}/toolbox.png){:class="img-responsive"} 
2. Double-click the {{ component }}. A connection manager is automatically assigned to the {{ component }} and the main window of the {{ component }} opens.

	!!! note
		If there are multiple connection managers, the window "Select Connection Manager" opens, see [SAP Connection](../sap-connection/index.md#assign-connection-managers-to-xtract-components).
		Once a connection manager is selected, the main window of the {{ component }} opens.

The majority of the functions of the {{ component }} can be accessed in the main window.
