#### Trace Directory

You can log debug information and save it locally. <br>
Enter a path to a local directory in the field **Trace directory** to save the debug information.
For more information, see [Troubleshooting: Trace Directory](https://support.theobald-software.com/helpdesk/KB/View/14455-how-to-activate-tracing-for-xtract-products).

Clear the **Trace Directory** field when it is not needed.

!!! warning
	**Increase of used hard drive memory.** <br>
	A big amount of information is collected when debug logging is activated. This can decrease the capacity of your hard drives dramatically.
	Activate the debug logging only when necessary e.g., upon request of the support team.
