### About Function Modules / BAPIs

Function modules are procedures that encapsulate and reuse global functions in the SAP system. 
SAP systems contain several predefined functions modules that can be called from any ABAP program. 
A Business Application Programming Interface (BAPI) is a remote function module that can access business data and processes of an SAP system from different systems.
<!---
Every Function Module / BAPI provides import and export parameters. 
These parameters are used to pass or get scalar values. An exchange of tables is also possible.
