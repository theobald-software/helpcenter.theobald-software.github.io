### About SAP Queries

SAP Queries are used to access data sets, see [SAP Documentation - Working with Queries](https://help.sap.com/viewer/b1c834a22d05483b8a75710743b5ff26/7.51.6/en-US/0e05493bbccf41a79caed7099c82bd48.html) for more information.

The SAP queries that can be used with {{ query }} {{ component }} are created by the SAP transactions SQ02 and SQ01.
To use a BW Query as a data source, see [BW InfoCubes and BExQueries](../bw-cube/index.md).
