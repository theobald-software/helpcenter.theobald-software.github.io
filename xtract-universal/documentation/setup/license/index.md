### About the Licensing Concept of Xtract Universal

Xtract Universal is licensed per Windows server. The license is bound to your company and a specific server name. If you run the Xtract Universal Designer and the Xtract Universal Server on different machines, it is only necessary to replace the license on the server.

A trial license is automatically installed with the installation of Xtract Universal.\
A regular license is provided in the [customer portal - My Theobald Software](https://my.theobald-software.com/) after purchasing the product.

The license defines the following properties:

- The name of the server that runs the Xtract Universal Server.
- The destinations to which you can extract data to.
- The number of extractions you can define.

These properties are checked when the XtractUniversal Server runs an extraction.

Note

The number of defined extractions and other license information is displayed in the status bar at the bottom of the Designer.

Recommendation

According to our experience, medium-sized businesses use less than 100 extractions.

### Install the Xtract Universal License

Place the "XtractUniversalLicense.json" file that is provided in the [Customer Portal - My Theobald Software](https://my.theobald-software.com) into the installation directory on the server, e.g., `C:\Program Files\XtractUniversal`.

Tip

To inspect your current license data, open the Xtract Universal Designer and navigate to **[Help] > [Info]** in the main menu bar. Alternatively, press **[F12]**.

### Move a License to a new Server

When moving your setup to a new server, a new license file must be issued for that server. Contact our sales team at [sales@theobald-software.com](mailto:sales@theobald-software.com) to let us know the name of the new server.

For more information on the migration process, see [Migration to a Different Machine](../migration/#migration-to-a-different-machine).
