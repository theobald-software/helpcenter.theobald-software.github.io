This change was made so our software uses the least privileges required.\n\nWhen upgrading older versions, no manual work is required. The setup will not change the user for the service in existing installations.\n\nIf no previous installation exists, or if it was previously uninstalled, the new service will be created using the virtual service user. You can either, if necessary, manually migrate the permissions of TLS certificates and reset all source passwords or change the service to run as the local system account again. Refer to our [online help on how to grant access to machine store certificates](https://helpcenter.theobald-software.com/xtract-universal/documentation/server/service-account/).\n\n## SAP source password protection\n\nThe encryption method for SAP source passwords was changed from user context specific cryptography to asymmetric cryptography using a per-instance key. This allows migration of sources by also migrating the generated `private/secrets/sources.pem` file. Make sure the directories and files are sufficiently protected when manually moving or changing them.\n\n### Access Restriction sanity checks\n\nThe server will refuse using the `private/secrets/sources.pem` file to store or retrieve passwords when the directory or file have access restrictions that are too permissive. It requires the access to be restricted to individual users or groups only. That means generic access for `Everyone` or `Users` well-known SIDs will be blocked.\n\n### Conversion and issues after installation\n\nWhen the `private/secrets` directories and `sources.pem` file have been created using a different service account, then manual action is required to switch the service user. This can happen after freshly installing the product and initially connecting to the server without changing the service user first. Either action can be taken to resolve the issue\n\n- remove the `private` directory and let the service create a new one, this will cause existing passwords to be lost\n- grant access to the new service user to `private/secrets` and `sources.pem` "

Use [json endpoint](https://help.theobald-software.com/en/xtract-universal/advanced-techniques/metadata-access-via-http-json) instead\n* `/parameters?name=extractionName` has been removed. Use [json endpoint](https://help.theobald-software.com/en/xtract-universal/advanced-techniques/metadata-access-via-http-json) instead\n* `/clearResultCache` has been removed\n* `/CurrentVersion` does now serve a json payload. It also does only serve one version, since the 'kernel' dependency was dropped\n\n## `/log?req_type=all` has been removed\nTo fetch the full logs for an extraction the prefered workflow is:\n* Get the timestamp for the extraction from the xu.exe output or the header of the HTTP response.\n* Request the run log for the extraction with `log?req_type=extraction&name=extractionname&timestamp=extractionTimestamp`\n* If that does not hold the desired information:\n  * There now is a `WebLog` column when listing the extractions runs with `log?req_type=extraction&name=extractionname`\n  * Use this timestamp to request the corresponding server log for the extraction with `log?req_type=server&timestamp=serverTimestamp`\n\nWe aim to provide a more consistent and useful Web API as part of upcoming releases.\n\n# Deprecations\nThe `clearBuffer` parameter for extraction requests was renamed to `ignoreCache` and does just that instead of purging the whole cache. The `clearBuffer` parameter will be removed in a future release.\n\n# Other\n* Web server, result cache and the engine which runs the extractions (runtime) were rewritten.\n* When running extractions the web server now responds with an HTTP error code and an error message instead of a 200 without any data or information if the SAP system yielded an error or preparing the destination failed. An error while writing the data to the destination will still only show up in the logs\n* Web server authentication: HTTPS + Designer Read access is now the same as HTTPS + Anonymous if Designer access is not restricted. Before one had to supply (any) Basic credentials but they were not checked."

It's now much faster, displays results as shown in SAP GUI and the extraction results can be used more flexibly. Depending on your use case, upgrading to the new extractor could cause some issues.\n* Hierarchies with up to 1 million rows can now be extracted within minutes\n* New Hierarchy extraction editor window with option to retrieve a live preview\n* Order of entries is now identical to order shown in SAP GUI. This includes the Node Ids (for Parent-Child representation) that are now also identical to those shown in SAP GUI.\n* Additional representation: Parent-Child with Node Names. This representation is somewhere in the middle between Parent-Child and Natural representation. It contains the Id of each Node and the Id of that Node's parent. It also contains the Name of the parent Node and the InfoObject name of the parent Node.\n* Newly created Hierarchy extractions now contain two additional columns: Link and Row (see below). These new columns are only enabled for newly created Hierarchy extractions. Existing extractions will not contain these columns (to avoid breaking existing extractions due to new columns).\n* The row column indicates the row number of that row. You can use this as a primary key in databases and/or ordering criterium. This allows you to restore the order as shown in SAP just by sorting by the row column.\n* The Link column is relevant for Hierarchies with link nodes. It shows the Node Id (Parent-Child, Parent-Child with Node Names representation) or Row Number (Natural representation) of the \"original\" Node that this Node is linking to. Otherwise this column will be zero.\n* Natural Representation now correctly extracts zero SAP dates (\"00000000\") as such instead of an invalid date. If you are using Date Conversion, this could yield different results than before.\n* The configuration files of existing extractions are backwards-compatible to previous versions, even when you edit them, as long as you choose Parent-Child or Natural representation."

When multiple users were generating reports at the same time, HttpClient reused existing connections as long as they made requests to the same destination (the XU web server).\n\nThe result was that the connection was authenticated using the credentials of the first user to generate a report. If another report was generated (by a different user) while that connection was still open, the credentials of the new user were ignored and the data was fetched in the name of the first user. Additionally, HttpClient was at liberty to keep connections open for an undefined amount of time. The XU webserver was not expecting this behaviour and was not enforcing a new authentication. Both issues have now been fixed.\n\nA new instance of HttpClient is now created for every connection object that the report server creates using the plugin. This guarantees a new connection being opened for each report generation."

Column names might not be unique with this style. Use at own risk.\n- Definition of runtime parameters as known from other extractors for manual filters and BEx variables\n- Introduced new runtime parameter type List\n\n## Reworked MDX Cube extraction mode\nPrevious extractions will be upgraded by our converter tool (See breaking changes)\n\n- Updated internal structure with improvements to allow implementation of new features in the future\n- Improved extraction performance\n- Various minor bug fixes\n- New and improved GUI\n- MDX Cube extraction preview in Designer\n\n## New BICS Cube extraction mode (BETA)\n- Replaces the previous BEx 3.x mode\n- Extraction of Infocubes and Queries using the BICS interface\n- This mode is still in beta. Use it with caution. Multiple breaking changes until final release are possible and likely\n- For using the BICS mode the user needs the [permissions as described in our knowledge base](https://kb.theobald-software.com/sap/authority-objects-sap-user-rights#bw-query--bw-cube)\n\n## Breaking changes\n- Custom MDX mode not supported and will not be converted. Please contact our support if you are using this mode\n- BEx 3.x mode not supported and will not be converted. Please contact our support if you are using this mode\n- Column order and naming might change\n- Corner case: combination of column name style TextAndCode or CodeAndText and \"Use description for columns\" setting will set column name style to Text\n- Converted extractions will work as before as long as they stay unchanged\n- Making changes to converted extractions requires a metadata refresh. After editing the new naming scheme will be used\n- Non-Unicode systems may not be compatible with the new cube component\n\n## Known issues\n- Renaming already assigned list parameters is not yet supported and will cause issues\n- BICS metadata retrieval may fail on some systems. Please send in traces if you encounter issues with metadata retrieval"

You can also manually run the `ConfigConverter.exe` after installation.\n\n## Other features\n- Changing the destination of multiple extractions at once now asks if settings should be copied or left as-is\n\n## Bug fixes\n- Fixed a bug that prevented the Designer from clearing the result cache and aborting extractions when Active Directory Access Control was activated on the web server\n- Fixed a bug where the mass-update of destination settings used the last selected extraction as template instead of the extraction which was selected first"

        "ReleaseNote": "This release adds support for multibyte codepages on non-Unicode SAP systems.\nFurthermore, the `ReadTable` class has been re-engineered, which includes a few breaking changes:\n\n### Removed ReadTable.AddCriteria()\nThis method had several unexpected consquences. Please use the `WhereClause` property instead.\n\n### Removed ReadTable.Delimiter\nThis used to be a workaround for non-Unicode multibyte codepages. Full multibyte support has been implemented, therefore the delimiter is not needed anymore.\n\n### Removed ReadTable.UsePrimaryKeyPackaging\nPackaging is primarily performed on the ABAP side. Please use custom function modules if you have special requirements for packaging.\n\n### ReadTable.Fields behaves differently\nThe `Fields` collection is used for both field selection and result metadata. Calling `ReadTable.AddField()` will add a field to this collection. In previous versions, the collection had only been used for result metadata.\n\nIn combination with `RetrieveAllFieldsOfTable()` that means, you can remove the fields that you don't want to extract from the `Fields` collection. If you want to use `AddField()`, please clear the collection after calling `RetrieveAllFieldsOfTable()` or use separate `ReadTable` instances.\n\n### Removed UseMultibyteExtraction flag from LINQtoERP\nThis flag has no use anymore, since multibyte codepages are fully supported without setting any flags or using other workarounds.\n\n### IncomingPackage & PackageProgress\n`PackageProgress` is fired always - `RaiseIncomingPackageEvent` no longer disables the `PackageProgress` event.\n\n`IncomingPackage` is no longer fired  if package is empty."

        "ReleaseNote": "## ERPConnect20.dll\n\n`ERPConnect20.dll` has been around since the early days of .NET 2.0 in 2005.\nOn July 12, 2011 Microsoft stopped supporting .NET Framework versions\n* [2.0](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/search/?p1=8291)\n* [3.x prior to 3.5 SP1](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/search/?p1=12292).\nThat means, there have been no updates published by Microsoft for more than five years now for these .NET versions, not even security patches.\nSupport by Microsoft for [Visual Studio 2005](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/2016/03/11/support-ending-for-visual-studio-2005/) ended on April 12, 2016.\nTherefore, we decided to remove `ERPConnect20.dll`. It can be easly replaced with `ERPConnect35.dll` or `ERPConnect45.dll`\n\n## ERPConnect40.dll and ERPConnect45.dll\n\nSupport by Microsoft  for .NET Framework [4, 4.5 and 4.5.1](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/search/?p1=14380) ended on January 12, 2016.\n\nThat means there have been no updates and no security patches for these .NET versions for more that a year now.\nTherefore, we also decided to remove `ERPConnect40.dll`. Like `ERPConnect20.dll`, it can be easly replaced with `ERPConnect35.dll` or `ERPConnect45.dll`.\nWe also updated the target for `ERPConnect45.dll` to .NET Framework 4.5.2.\n\n## Migration\n\nIf you have been using `ERPConnect20.dll` or `ERPConnect40.dll` in your projects, please replace all references to those assemblies with either `ERPConnect35.dll` or `ERPConnect45.dll`.\n\nIf you want your software to run on `CLR2`, use `ERPConnect35.dll` and target NET Framework 3.5 / .NET Framework 3.5 Client Profile.\n\nIf you don't need to support CLR2, use `ERPConnect45.dll` and target .NET Framework 4.5.2 or higher\n\n[Common Langauge Runtime (CLR)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/8bs2ecf4.aspx) \n[How to: Target a Version of the .NET Framework](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb398202.aspx)\n\n## SOAP is no longer supported by ERPConnect\n\nBecause of performance issues related to the verbosity of XML and low customer demand, support for SOAP connections has been removed. SOAP had been marked as deprecated since May 06, 2015. Please use `ClientProtocol.NWRFC` or `ClientProtocol.RFC instead`"
