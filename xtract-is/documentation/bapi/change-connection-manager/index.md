This page shows how to change the [XTRACT Connection Manager](../../sap-connection/#connect-to-sap) that is assigned to an Xtract BAPI component.

### About XTRACT Connection Managers in Xtract BAPI

An XTRACT connection Manager is automatically assigned or selected when you open the main window of the Xtract BAPI component for the first time, see [Assign Connection Managers to Xtract Components](../../sap-connection/#assign-connection-managers-to-xtract-components). Connection managers are usually changed in the *Advanced Editor* of a component. Because the Xtract BAPI component does not have an *Advanced Editor*, it is not possible to change the connection manager outside of the component.

### Change the XTRACT Connection Manager

Follow the steps below to change the connnection manager of an Xtract BAPI component:

1. In the main window of the Xtract BAPI component, click **Change Connection Manager**. This option is only available when there is more than one defined XTRACT Connection Manager. The window "Select Connection Manager" opens.
1. Select a Connection Manager from the drop-down-menu.
1. Click **[OK]** to confirm your selection.

The selected XTRACT connection manager is now assigned to the Xtract BAPI component.
