- SAP industry solutions like IS-U, IS-R, etc. are supported.
- SAP releases 4.6C and newer are supported.
- All operating systems are supported.

**Disclaimer**

While SAP versions that are no longer supported by SAP still work with Theobald Software products, they are excluded from the Theobald Software support service.

#### Not Supported SAP Systems

- Analysis Views
- Calculation Views
- Associated Attribute Views

Direct access to a HANA database without an SAP ABAP source system running on the corresponding HANA database is not supported.
