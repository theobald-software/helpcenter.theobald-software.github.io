- SAP systems that don't provide RFC connectivity.

Examples

### HANA Database

You can use Operational Data Provisioning (ODP) to connect the SAP HANA database of an SAP ABAP source system. Communication is done via RFC. With the ODP context for SAP HANA (HANA) the following HANA View types are available for extracting:

- Analysis Views
- Calculation Views
- Associated Attribute Views

Direct access to a HANA database without an SAP ABAP source system running on the corresponding HANA database is not supported.

### Ports

The following ports between the Windows server that runs Xtract for Alteryx and the SAP server, must be open:

| SAP NetWeaver Component | Port (NN = System number of the SAP system) | | --- | --- | | SAP Application Server | 33<NN> | | SAP Message Server | 36<NN> | | Secure Network Communication (SNC) | 48<NN> | | SAP-Router | 3299 |
