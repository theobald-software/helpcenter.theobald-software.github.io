title: Style

When creating content style can be defined as “the way the author writes texts”. In the context of the UI the following aspects are considered: comprehensibility, simplicity, conciseness (as short as possible, as long as needed) and consistent word choice.

Keep in mind that readers have diverse cultural backgrounds and different English reading skills. As much as possible, avoid culturally specific references. Writing in a straightforward and uniform manner can also simplify the translation of documents into other languages.

Make big chunks of text easier to scan. Split bigger paragraphs into smaller paragraphs, make headings, and use lists.
