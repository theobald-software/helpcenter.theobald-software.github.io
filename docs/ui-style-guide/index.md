### About User Interface Style Guide
The User Interface Style Guide of Theobald Software provides a set of guidelines for writing for the UI of yunIO and other Theobald Software products. The guidelines are not binding rules that must be applied in every case. However, it is recommended to follow the User Interface Style Guide to improve the quality of the textual and language content of the UI in terms of consistency and correctness.

This style guide should be used as a reference containing the most important recommendations. User Interface Style Guide is a living document that can be changed and improved over time.
