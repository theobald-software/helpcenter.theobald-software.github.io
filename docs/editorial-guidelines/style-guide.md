## General
### About User Documentation Style Guide (UDSG)
The User Documentation Style Guide (Version 2.0) of Theobald Software provides a set of guidelines for writing documentation pages as in help content and knowledge base articles for all Theobald Software products. The guidelines are not binding rules that must be applied in every case. However, it is recommended to follow the UDSG to improve the quality of the textual and language content of the user documentation in terms of consistency and correctness.
The UDSG of Theobald Software should be used as a reference containing the most important recommendations. The provided cheat sheet is a short collection of the most important Style Guide items. More information can be found in the Google Developer Documentation Style Guide. The UDSG of Theobald Software is loosely based on Google Developer Style Guide and is a living document and can be changed and improved over time. Some of the guidelines collected in the Style Guide do not comply with the Google Style guide as Theobald Software products have needs that are not covered by Google.

### Scope
The User Documentation Style Guide of Theobald Software applies to the creation of content for the documentation pages and knowledge base articles of Theobald Software.
Other publications such as blog articles or any marketing publication do not have to comply with the Style Guide.
The UDSG of Theobald Software addresses the following topics:

- Style and choice of words
- Spelling and grammar
- Punctuation
- Standard phrases (growing)

Any information on formatting of the documents is not part of the Style Guide. To address formatting Theobald Software created a document template.

### How to use the User Documentation Style Guide
It is advisable to read all dedicated pages at least once and then use it as a reference and search for an item, if needed. 
Ground rules for using the Documentation Style Guide of Theobald Software:

- Always use the latest version of the Style Guide
- Discuss any deviations from the Style Guide with responsible colleagues
- Ideas, changes and extensions are welcome and should be added to the Style Guide in cooperation with a technical writer

## Style
When creating content style can be defined as the *way the author writes the texts*. In the context of the user assistance content of Theobald Software the following aspects are considered: tone, word choice, comprehensibility and simplicity. When writing for audiences that include non-native English speakers, it is important to write simple, straightforward sentences and avoid informal and spoken language expressions.
The style guidelines are based on the rules of the Chicago Manual of Style. The Chicago Manual of Style (abbreviated in writing as CMS or CMOS, or verbally as Chicago) is a Style Guide for American English published since 1906 by the University of Chicago Press. In the United States, it is the most widely used Style Guide for non-journalistic content that is to use when resolving doubts and issues concerning style.

### Tone
Tone is the narrative attitude towards the conveyed information being told. In non-technical texts examples for tone can be the following: irony, humor, sympathy or emotion, etc.
For technical user documentation the tone must be neutral and without any evaluation (e.g., “the option XYZ is the **best**” is evaluating). It is important not to try to influence the reader as it is common for marketing texts.
The following examples depict the usage of the correct tone.

|Instruction|Example|  
|----------|-------------|
| Friendly and respectful but avoid “please” as it is unnecessary.|:white_check_mark: To see the details of the license, navigate to the menu bar of the designer and select **[Help > Info]**.  <br> :x: To see the details of the license, please go to *Help -> Info.* |

### Choice of words
The choice of words is a very important part of any communication. Each author should try to use correct and precise words to convey the correct message. Incorrect word choice leads to misunderstandings among the audience. In technical user documentation it is not advisable to use synonyms – it is against the goal of consistent terminology. The following list of examples depicts the main principles of correct choice of words when creating documentation for users.
Other examples: email vs. e-mail, address vs. adress, definite vs. definet.
