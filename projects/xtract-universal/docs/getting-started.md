![img](site:assets/images/logos/theo-thumbs.png){ .lg .middle width="30px"} This section shows how to install and set up {{ productName }} for the first time.

{% include "xu-bc-getting-started.md" %}


### Target Environments

{{ productName }} allows you to load data to a wide range of target environments, including databases, cloud storages, BI tools, etc.
By default, extractions use the [**http-csv**](documentation/destinations/csv-via-http.md) destination as a target environment.

For information on how to set up and assign custom destinations to an extraction, see [Documentation: Destinations](documentation/destinations/index.md).
