### About the Licensing Concept of {{ productName }}

{{ productName }} is licensed per Windows server. The license is bound to your company and a specific server name.
If you run the {{ productName }} Designer and the {{ productName }} Server on different machines, it is only necessary to replace the license on the server.

A trial license is automatically installed with the installation of {{ productName }}.<br>
A regular license is provided in the [customer portal - My Theobald Software](https://my.theobald-software.com/) after purchasing the product.
