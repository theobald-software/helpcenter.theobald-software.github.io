description: Defining a WHERE Clause to filter table records

A WHERE clause can be used to filter table records, see [SAP ABAP Documentation: SELECT-WHERE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_750_index_htm/7.50/en-us/abapwhere.htm).
Enter WHERE clauses manually in *Text mode* or use the [WHERE Clause Editor](#where-clause-editor) in *Editor Mode*.<br>
