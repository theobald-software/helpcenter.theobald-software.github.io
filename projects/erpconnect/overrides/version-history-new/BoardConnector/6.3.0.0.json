Therefore the extraction \nname is provided as part of the URL path. This leads to the following structure:\n\n- /run/$extractionName/\n  - This endpoint runs the extraction and waits for it to finish \n- /start/$extractionName/\n  - This endpoint starts the extraction and doesn't wait for the extraction to finish \n\n- Improvements \n  - Improved structure of URLs with different endpoints for waiting or just starting an extraction \n\n- Bug fixes \n  - Fixed a bug where the user-agent was expected as URL parameter instead of http header \n"
