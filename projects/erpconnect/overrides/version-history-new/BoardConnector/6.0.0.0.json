        "ReleaseNote": "BOARDConnector 6.0.0\n\n### Breaking changes\n\n- Web API\n  - /log/req_type=all has been removed\n    - To fetch the full logs for an extraction the prefered workflow is:\n      - Get the timestamp for the extraction from the xu.exe output or the header of the HTTP response.\n      - Request the run log for the extraction with log/req_type=extraction&name=extractionname&timestamp=extractionTimestamp\n      - If that does not hold the desired information:\n        - There now is a 'WebLog' column when listing the extractions runs with log/req_type=extraction&name=extractionname\n        - Use this timestamp to request the corresponding server log for the extraction with log/req_type=server&timestamp=serverTimestamp\n  - /log/req_type=server now yields the worker instead of listener log\n  - /metadata?name=extractionName has been removed\n    - Use [json endpoint](https://help.theobald-software.com/en/xtract-universal/advanced-techniques/metadata-access-via-http-json) instead\n  - /parameters?name=extractionName has been removed\n    - Use [json endpoint](https://help.theobald-software.com/en/xtract-universal/advanced-techniques/metadata-access-via-http-json) instead\n  - /clearResultCache has been removed\n    - use 'ignoreCache' to make sure an extraction loads new data, this will not create a cache entry.\n- Behavior\n  - ResultCache: default maximum age of a cache entry increased to 60 minutes.\n\nWe aim to provide a more consistent and useful Web API as part of upcoming releases.\n\n### Deprecations\n\n- The 'clearBuffer' parameter for extraction requests was renamed to 'ignoreCache' and does just that instead of purging the whole cache\n  - 'clearBuffer' will be removed in a future release\n\n### Other\n\n- Web server, result cache and the engine which runs the extractions (runtime) were rewritten.\n- When running extractions the web server now responds with an HTTP error code and an error message instead of a 200 without any data or information if the SAP system yielded an error or preparing the destination failed.\n- Web server authentication: HTTPS + Designer Read access is now the same as HTTPS + Anonymous if Designer access is not restricted\n  - Before one had to supply (any) Basic credentials but they were not checked.\n- Support for /THEO/READ_TABLE function module\n- DeltaQ UI fixes"
