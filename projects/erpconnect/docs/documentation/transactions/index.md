description: Managing and  Executing Transactions- The Class Transaction
---

This section shows how to use the *Transaction* class to execute SAP transactions in the foreground as well as in a background process (Batch Input).<br>
When executing transactions in a background process, mass data can be processed and transferred to the SAP system. 
This technique is often used if no suitable BAPI exists.

For more information on SAP transactions, see [SAP Documentation: Using Transaction Codes](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_NETWEAVER_740/b1c834a22d05483b8a75710743b5ff26/f735dd776e724195b5562592a5e88b45.html?locale=en-US).
