The following sections show how to develop RFC server functions with ERPConnect.

### About RFC Server Functions
RFC server functions are routines that can be called by ABAP programs, see [SAP Help - Introduction to RFC Server Programs](https://help.sap.com/doc/saphelp_srm70/7.0/en-US/22/042990488911d189490000e829fbbd/frameset.htm) for more information. <br>

Apart from the client functionality that allows function modules or BAPIs to be accessed in the SAP system, ERPConnect also offers the development of a server function.
ERPConnect supports Transactional RFC functions.
