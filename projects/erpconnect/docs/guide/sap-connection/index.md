This section contains information on how to connect to SAP systems.

### Prerequisites
ERPConnect requires an RFC library, see [SAP Libraries](../introduction/saplibraries/).

The RFC API (Remote Function Call) enables an RFC connection between an SAP system and an external system that can communicate with SAP as a client or server.
The RFC API has two versions:

- classic RFC-API (classic RFC library).
- Netweaver-RFC-API (Netweaver RFC library). 

For more information on the RFC libraries, see [SAP Help - RFC API: Classical & NetWeaver](https://help.sap.com/saphelp_nwpi71/helpdata/en/45/18e96cd26321a1e10000000a1553f6/frameset.htm).
