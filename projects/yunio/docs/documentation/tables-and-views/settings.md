#### Refresh metadata
A new lookup is performed on the selected table(s).

- another SAP source system has been connected
- the SAP source system has been updated

### Output Columns

You can select either all or only individual columns for extraction. <br>
Per default all columns are selected to be extracted. 
Deselect the columns you donâ€™t want to extract.

### WHERE Clause
You can use a WHERE clause to filter table records, see [SAP ABAP Documentation: SELECT-WHERE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_750_index_htm/7.50/en-us/abapwhere.htm).
Enter WHERE clauses manually in *Text mode* or use the [WHERE Clause Editor](where-clause.md/#where-clause-editor) in *Editor Mode*.<br>
