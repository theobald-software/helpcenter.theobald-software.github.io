### About Transaction Codes

Transaction codes represent functions in the SAP system. 
They can be used in the SAP command field to quickly go to an SAP task and start a function.
A transaction code consists of letters and/or numbers, e.g., *VA01* to create sales orders, *ME21N* to create purchase orders, etc. 
For information on how to use and find transaction codes, see [SAP Documentation: Using Transaction Codes](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_NETWEAVER_740/b1c834a22d05483b8a75710743b5ff26/f735dd776e724195b5562592a5e88b45.html)
