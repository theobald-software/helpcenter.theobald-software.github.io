### Access the yunIO Designer

The URL pattern to access the yunIO Designer is `http(s)://[host or IP address]:[port]`.<br>
- If the yunIO service runs on a local server, replace `[host]` with *localhost*.
- If the yunIO service does not run on the same machine as the browser, replace `[host]` with the name or IP address of the host on which the service runs.
- After the installation the yunIO Designer is accessible under the default port 8077. <br>
The port can be configured in the [:yunio-nav-settings: *Settings*](../server-settings.md) menu of the Designer.

!!! note
    Make sure that the YunIO Service is running on your windows system and that the default port 8077 is not blocked by your firewall.

### Version Number

To check your current version number, navigate to the :yunio-nav-about: *About* menu in the yunIO Designer. <br>
