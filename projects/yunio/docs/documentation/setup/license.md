### About the Licensing Concept of yunIO

yunIO is licensed per Windows server, where the solution is installed.
A trial license valid for 30 days is automatically provided with the installation of yunIO.


A regular license is provided in the [Theobald Software Costumer Portal](https://my.theobald-software.com/) after purchasing the product. The product license is bound to your company, and the server on which the yunIO server runs.<br>
