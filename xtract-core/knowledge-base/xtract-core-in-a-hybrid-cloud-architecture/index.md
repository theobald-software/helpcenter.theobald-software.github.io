This article outlines a use case where Xtract Core is deployed within a hybrid cloud architecture, combining on-premises SAP connectivity with a cloud-based user interface.

### About the Application

As a white-label solution, Xtract Core enables third-party applications to extract data from SAP systems via RESTful services. A typical implementation scenario involves integration into a hybrid cloud architecture. In this setup, Xtract Core is deployed within the end customerâ€™s on-premises network to maintain direct access to their SAP environment and to ensure secure and compliant data extraction. Meanwhile, the cloud-based component of the application delivers the user interface.

The application uses Xtract Core to:

- Create and delete SAP data sources
- Fetch tables and table metadata from SAP systems
- Create and delete destinations for the SAP data
- Create and delete Table extractions
- Run extractions
